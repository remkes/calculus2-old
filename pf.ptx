  <title>Partial Fractions</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        After long division and factoring, this section introduces a
        new algebraic technique for understanding rational functions.
        This technique is the basis for integrating rational function,
        but by itself is just an algebraic technique. It is
        essentially doing common denominator in reverse. Therefore,
        let me start by reviewing common denominator with polynomials.

    <title>Common Denominators</title>
    <p>
      When adding or subtracting polynomials, it is necessary to take
      the polynomials to a common denominator. In general, this can by
      done by simply multiplying the denominators together to form the
      common denominator, then multiplying the numerators by the
      appropriate factors to preserve the fractions. (A fraction is
      preserved when the numerator and denominator are multiplied by
      the same term.) Here is a simple example that just multiplies
      the two denominators together. 
    </p>
    <me>
      \frac{1}{x-3} + \frac{1}{x+4} = \frac{(x+4) +
      (x-3)}{(x-3)(x+4)} = \frac{2x+1}{x^2+x-12}
    </me>
    <p>
      However, like with fractions, its often wise to make use of
      common factors already existing in the denominators. To add the
      fractions <m>\frac{7}{16}</m> and <m>\frac{5}{24}</m>, it makes
      more sense to use the common denominator <m>48</m>, since <m>3
      \times 16 = 48</m> and <m>2 \times 24 = 48</m>. (For those of
      you who remember your algebra, this <m>48</m> is the least
      common multiple or LCM of <m>16</m> and <m>24</m>.) Certainly,
      it is nice to use <m>48</m> rather than the product of the two
      terms <m>384</m>. The same thing works for rational functions.
      Consider this example, where the two polynomials share a factor.
      I only need to multiply the first polynomial by <m>(x-1)</m> and
      the second polynomial by <m>x^2</m> to form the common
      denominator of <m>x^2(x-1)(x-3)</m>.

    <title>Undoing Common Denominator</title>
    <p>
      Common denominator takes the sum or difference of two or more
      rational functions and puts them together into one fraction.
      What is I want to do the opposite? Given a rational function,
      can I pull it apart into its various pieces? Can I do common
      denominator in reverse? 
    </p>
    <p>
      I can, and the technique is known as the <term>partial
      fractions decomposition</term> or, more commonly, just
      <term>partial fractions</term>. It applies to proper fractions
      with factored denominators, explaining the need to review these
      techniques in <xref ref="section-long-division" />. Assume that 
      <m>\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}</m> is a proper rational function and
      <m>q(x) = q_1(x) q_2(x) \ldots q_r(x)</m> is a factorization
      into linear and irreducible quadratic factors. Then I want to
      find new numerators <m>p_i</m> to undo the common denominator,
      as in the following expression.
    </p>
    <me>
      \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = \frac{p_1(x)}{q_1(x)} +
      \frac{p_2(x)}{q_2(x)} + \frac{p_3(x)}{q_3(x)} + \ldots +
      \frac{p_r(x)}{q_r(x)}
    </me>
    <p>
      Partial fractions tries to calculate these numerators. It is
      often a long and complicated process. Instead of trying to
      explain it abstractly, it's much more reasonable to explain it
      through examples. 
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-pf1">>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \frac{x+2}{(x+1)(x-6)}
        </me>
        <p>
          The partial fraction decomposition should write this as two
          fractions, each of which have only one of the two factors of
          the denominator. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \frac{x+2}{(x+1)(x-6)} = \frac{a}{x-6} + \frac{b}{x+1}
        </me>
        <p>
          The problem of partial fractions is to calculate the
          numerators <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. This is the general
          technique: I write the desired form with unknown numerators.
          All linear factor (of multiplicity one) will have constant
          numerators (since all the pieces have to proper as well, and
          a linear denominator for a proper fraction means a constant
          numerator). After writing the desired form with unknown
          numerators, I'll then simply construct the common
          denominator on the right side. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \frac{x+2}{(x+1)(x-6)} = \frac{a}{x-6} + \frac{b}{x+1} =
          \frac{a(x+1) + b(x-6)}{(x-6)(x+1)} = \frac{(a+b)x +
          (a-6b)}{(x+1)(x-6)}
        </me>
        <p>
          Taking the right side to common denominator makes the
          denominators the same. Since this is an equality, this means
          the numerators must also be the same. I write that fact as
          an equation.
        </p>
        <me>
          x+2 = (a+b)x + (a-6b)
        </me>
        <p>
          Now this is the next general step: I compare coefficients in
          the equation of numerators. This will give a system of
          equations in the unknowns. In this case, the coefficient of
          <m>x</m> and the constant coefficient must be the same.
          I can write this as two equations.
        </p>
        <md>
          <mrow>
            1 \amp = a+b
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            2 \amp = a-6b
          </mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
          I have to solve these two equations for <m>a</m> and
          <m>b</m>. I do this by isolating and replacing. (For
          students with linear algebra, know that the system in
          partial fractions will always be a linear system. Feel free
          to use the matrix techniques of linear algebra to solve
          these systems if you wish.) The first
          equation gives <m>a = 1-b</m>, which I substitute in the
          second equation to get <m>2 = (1-b) -6b</m> which is <m>1 =
          -7b</m> or <m>b = \frac{-1}{7}</m>. The I substitute back
          to get <m>a = 1-b = 1 - \frac{-1}{7} = \frac{8}{7}</m>.
          Now I've sovled the systems and I know the unknowns from the
          numerators. I can now write the original partial fraction
          decomposition with these values in the numerators.
        </p>
        <me>
          \frac{x+2}{(x+1)(x-6)} = \frac{\frac{8}{7}}{x-6} +
          \frac{\frac{-1}{7}}{x+1}
        </me>
        <p>
          That's the end of the process. The right side is the partial
          fraction composition: it is common denominator in reverse.
          The rational function is separated in a sum of the simplest
          possible fractions.

      After one example, I can summarize the steps of the algorithm. I
      assume that I am starting with a proper rational function with a
      factored denominator.

        <p>
          There are three linear factors in the denominator. I expect
          the partial fractions decomposition to split up into three
          pieces, one for each of these linear factors. The numerators
          will be constant. This is the form I expect:

          Now I need to determine the unknowns <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>

          decomposition with the unknowns and creating a common
          denominator. For each term with one linear factor in the
          denominator, I have to multiply by the other two linear
          factors to produce the common denominator. Then I simplify
          and group the resulting numerator.

    <title>Multiple Factors</title>
    <p>
      So far, I've done examples with linear factors an irreducible
      quadratic factors. The only thing I haven't done is examples
      that have factors with multiplicity. For the needs of this
      course, I'm only going to worry about linear factor with
      multiplicity. (There is an equivalent process for irreducible
      quadratic factors with multiplicity, but seeing integrals with
      multiple quadratic factors in the denominator is rare enougth
      that I feel it's reasonable to skip this piece.)
    </p>
    <p>
      For, let me assume I have a denominator factor <m>(x-\alpha)^n</m>
      for some multiplicity <m>n \geq 2</m>. To turn this into
      partial fractions, I need a decomposition that includes a sum of
      terms with various powers of this linear denominator.
    </p>
    <me>
      \frac{a_1}{(x-\alpha)} + 
      \frac{a_2}{(x-\alpha)^2} + 
      \frac{a_3}{(x-\alpha)^3} + \ldots + 
      \frac{a_n}{(x-\alpha)^n} 
    </me>
    <p>
      This gives enough piece to put together the original rational
      function. If I don't have all these terms, I won't have enough
      information to solve the system of equations. Let me
      illustrate this method with an example.

        </me>
        <p>
          To account for the repeated root, I look for a partial
          fraction decomposition of the following form.
        </p>
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \frac{2x-3}{(x-1)(x+2)^2} \amp = \frac{a}{x-1} +
            \frac{b}{x+2} + \frac{c}{(x+2)^2}
          </mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
          As always, I take the right side to common denominator, so
          that I can compare numerators and make a system of
          equations.

        <md>
          <mrow>
            \frac{2x-3}{(x-1)(x-2)^2}\amp = \frac{a(x+2)^2 +
            b(x+2)(x-1) + c(x-1)} {(x-1)(x-2)^2}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \amp = \frac{ax^2 + 4ax + 4a + bx^2 + bx - 2b + cx - c}
            {(x-1)(x-2)^2}

          <mrow>
            \amp = \frac{(a+b)x^2 + (4a+b+c)x + (4a-2b-c)}

          </mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
          I compare the coefficients of the numerators to get the
          system of equations.
          </p>
        <md>
          <mrow>
            a+b \amp = 0

            4a + b + c \amp = 2
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            4a-2b-c \amp = -3
          </mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
          I solve the system. Start with the first equation is nice,
          because I can replace all the <m>b</m> coefficients quickly. 
        </p>
        <md>
          <mrow>
            b \amp = -a
          </mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
          Then I substitute this into the second equation.
        </p>
        <md>
          <mrow>
            4a + (-a) + c \amp = 2

          <mrow>
            3a + c \amp = 2
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            a \amp = \frac{2-c}{3}
          </mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
          Then I substitute this into the third equation. After
          solving for <m>c</m>, I can replace in previous equations to
          find <m>b</m> and finally <m>a</m>. 
        </p>

          <mrow>

            8 - 4x - 2c + 4 - 3c \amp = -9

          <mrow>
            -9c \amp = -21
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            c \amp = \frac{7}{3}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            a \amp = \frac{2 - \frac{7}{3}}{3} = \frac{-1}{9}

          <mrow>
            b \amp = -a = \frac{1}{9}
          </mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
          The system is solved, so I can write the partial fraction
          decomposition.

          \frac{2x-3}{(x-1)(x+2)^2} = \frac{\frac{-1}{9}}{x-1} +
