        Another name for loci in <m>\RR^2</m> is
        <term>plane curves</term>.
        An <term>algebraic plane curve</term>
        is a locus where the expressions are polynomials.

  <p>
    Algebraic plane curves include all conics as well as the previous example <m>x^4 + y^4 = 1</m>.
    They are the historical root of a large branch of mathematics called algebraic geometry,
    which deals with the geometry of such polynomial plane curves and their higher-dimensional analogues.

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>degree</term> of an algebraic plane curve is the highest polynomial degree involved in the equation of the curve.

    When we study the geometry of algebraic plane curves,
    we often wonder what happens at problematic points.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A point where the tangent line to an algebraic plane curve is not defined is called a <term>singularity</term>.

    We'll use this section to try to understand the singularities of simple algebraic plane curves.
    First, let's talk about the case of vertical tangent lines.
    The slope of a vertical line isn't defined,
    but the tangent line can exist.
    Our singularities are located where a
    <em>tangent line</em> doesn't exist.
    Therefore, vertical tangents are fine <mdash/> they aren't singularities.
    That said, in what follows,
    we will also get a method for identifying vertical tangents.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are, broadly speaking,
    two types of singularity for algebraic plane curves: nodes and cusps.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>node</term> occurs at the self-intersection of a plane curve.
        We count the number of times the curve overlaps:
        two overlaps is often called a <term>double point</term>,
        three a <term>triple point</term>, and so on.
        A <term>cusp</term>, on the other hand, is a sharp corner.

    To understand singularities,
    we will look at the problematic points of the implicit derivative.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the plane curve given by the equation <m>y^2 = 4 - 3x^2 - x^3</m>.
        This is a degree 3 curve,
        which factors as <m>y^2 = (1-x)(2+x)^2</m>. (A factored form is often conveninet for these calculations,
        when it is possible to find such a form.) Let's look at the implicit derivative.
        <me>
          2 y \frac{dy}{dx} = -6x - 3x^2 \implies \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-6x-3x^2}{2y}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is well defined except when <m>y=0</m> which,
        for this curve, happens at <m>(1,0)</m> and <m>(-2,0)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's look at a different form of the implicit derivative,
        where we replace <m>y</m> with its expression in <m>x</m>.
        <me>
          \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-3x(2+x)}{\pm\sqrt{(1-x)(2+x)^2}} = \frac{-3(2+x)}{\pm\sqrt{1-x} (2+x)}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then we can look at the limits as we approach the undefined points.
        When <m>x=1</m>,
        only the denominator goes to <m>0</m>, the numerator is finite.
        Therefore, we expect the slope diverges to infinity.
        This means the tangent line is approaching vertical and,
        in the limit,
        we recognize a vertical tangent.
        There is no singularity here, just a vertical tangent.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will be our first rule:
        when the limit of the implicit derivative approaching an undefined point is <m>\pm \infty</m>,
        we get a vertical tangent.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, at <m>x=-2</m>,
        both numerator and denominator have a <m>x+2</m> term,
        which can cancel out. (The limit is an indeterminate form of type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>).
        Evaluating the limit gives a slope of <m>\frac{-3}{\pm\sqrt{3}}</m>.
        We get two slopes, neither of which are vertical.
        This situation indicates a self-intersection,
        with the incoming lines at the two given slopes.
        Moreover, since we have two possible tangents,
        there are two intersecting pieces and the node is a double point.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is our second rule:
        when the limit of the implicit derivative approaching an undefined point is an indeterminant form of type
        <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> which evaluates to several possible values,
        we have a node.
        The number of possible values gives the number of self-intersections and hence the type of the node
        (double point, triple point, etc).
        <xref ref="figure-elliptic-curve1">Figure</xref>
        shows a vertical tangent and a double point node.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  </figure>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Lastly, consider the curve
        <m>y^2 = x^3</m> with implicit derivative <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3x^2}{2y} = \frac{3x^2}{\pm \sqrt{x^3}}</m>.
        This is undefined at the point <m>(0,0)</m> on the curve,
        and the limit as we approach the undefined point is <m>0</m>.
        This behaviour indicates a cusp,
        which is our third and final rule:
        the when the limit of the implicit derivative approaching an underinfed point is an indeterminant form of type
        <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> which evaluates to <m>0</m>, then we have a cusp.
        <xref ref="figure-elliptic-curve2">Figure</xref> shows a cusp.
