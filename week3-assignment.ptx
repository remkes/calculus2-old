        Consider the following two conics. (6) 
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>
          (x-2)^2 + (y-2)^2 \amp = 1 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          (x-1)^2 - (y-2)^2 \amp = 1 
        </mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        Calculate the intersection of the two conics (there are three
        intersection points). Use implicit derivatives to find the
        slopes of the tangent lines to each curve at the intersection
        point. Identify the one intersection point where the slopes
        are the same.  (This shows that the two conics meet
        tangentially: they touch briefly as they pass by each other
        but don't cross over each other).
