        Consider the following two conics. (8) 
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>
          (x-1)^2 + (y+2)^2 \amp = 1 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \frac{(x-1)^2}{4} + \frac{(y-2)^2}{9} \amp = 1 
        </mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        Calculate the intersection of the two conics (there is one
        intersection point). Use implicit derivatives to find the
        slopes of the tangent lines to each curve at the intersection
        point. Observe that the two tangents lines have the same
        slope. (This shows that the two conics meet tangentially: they
        touch briefly as they pass by each other but don't cross over
        each other).
