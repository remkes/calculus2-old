    <title>Analytic Functions</title>
    <p>
      Once again, consider the geometric series:
    </p>
    <me>
      f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n = \frac{1}{1-x}
    </me>
    <p>
      Unlike most of the power series I could define, I actually
      know the values of the geometric series. This series, as a
      function, is the same as the function <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m> on
      the domain <m>(-1,1)</m>.(The function <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m> is
      certainly defined on a larger domain, but the series is not).
      I can say that the geometric series lets me write
      <m>\frac{1}{1-x}</m> as an infinite series; it is the infinite
      series <em>representation</em> of the function on the domain
      <m>(-1,1)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theory of Taylor series generalizes this situation. For
      various functions <m>f(x)</m>, I want to a build representation
      of <m>f(x)</m> as a series. This will be a power series which
      is identical to <m>f(x)</m>, at least for part of its domain.
      To find the power series, I need to choose a centre point
      <m>\alpha</m> and find coefficients <m>c_n</m> to build the
      series. 
    </p>
    <me>
      f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (x-\alpha)^n
    </me>
    <p>
      These two pieces of information, the centre point and the
      coefficients, they are everything. Often I can choose the centre
      point, so I am really trying to calculate the coefficient to
      represent a function as a series. When is such a project
      possible? I need a definition before stating the relevant
      theorem. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function is called <term>analytic</term> at <m>\alpha \in
          \RR</m> if it can be expressed as a power series centered at
          <m>\alpha</m> with a non-zero radius of convergence. Such a
          power series is called a <term>Taylor series</term>
          representation of the function. In the case that <m>\alpha
          = 0</m>, a Taylor series is often called a <term>MacLaurin
          series</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      I know that power series (and therefore all possible Taylor
      series) are <m>C^\infty</m>. There is a nice theorem that
      provides the reverse implication.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> is <m>C^\infty</m> at a point <m>\alpha
          \in \RR</m> if and only if <m>f</m> is analytic at 
          <m>\alpha</m>. (Recall that analytic includes the condition
          that the radius of convergence of the resulting series must
          be positive or infinity). 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This theorem answers the question of which functions have
      Taylor series representations: any function which is infinitely
      differentiable can be expressed as a series, but no other
      functions can be so expressed.

    <title>Calculating Coefficients</title>
    <p>
      The previous section defined a class of analytic functions, but
      it didn't explain how to actually find the series for these
      functions. I get to choose the centre point <m>\alpha</m>, so
      I need to know how to calculate the coefficients <m>c_n</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My approach is a typical on in mathematics: I'm going to assume
      there is a solution and see what the pieces need to be to make
      it work. Therefore, assume there is a 
      series expression of <m>f(x)</m>. 
    </p>
    <me>
      f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (x - \alpha)^n
    </me>
    <p>
      Now I will calculate the value of <m>f</m> and is derivatives
      evaluated at the centre point <m>\alpha</m>. Recall that to
      differentiate a series, I can differentiate term by term. Each
      time I differentiate, I move the starting point of the index up
      by one; I do this because the starting value of a power series
      is the constant piece and this will disappear when I
      differentiable. Here are the first few result. 
    </p>

        f(\alpha) \amp = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (\alpha-\alpha)^n =

        \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(\alpha)}{2}

        = 6c_3 \implies c_3 = \frac{f^{(3)}(\alpha)}{6}

      <mrow>
        f^{(4)} (\alpha) \amp = \sum_{n=4}^\infty c_n n (n-1) (n-2)

      <mrow>
        f^{(4)} (\alpha) \amp = 24c_4 \implies c_4 =

    <p>
      There is a pattern here relating to the coefficients of the
      series. I've solved for those coefficient in the calculations to
      try to show the pattern. Based on what I've done so far, I can
      argue for the following general pattern.
    </p>
    <me>
      c_n = \frac{f^{(n)}(\alpha)}{n!}
    </me>
    <p>
      Now I have a way to calculate the coefficient in terms of the
      derivatives of <m>f(x)</m> at the chosen centre point.
      Therefore, to find a series representation of <m>f(x)</m>
      centered at <m>\alpha</m> (assuming <m>f(x)</m> is analytic at
      <m>\alpha</m>), I use this expression o calculate the
      coefficients. I summarize this in a proposition.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is analytic at <m>\alpha</m>, then the Taylor
          series for <m>f</m> has the following form.
          <me>
            f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(\alpha)}{n!}
            (x-\alpha)^n
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      The expression for the coefficients <m>c_n</m> allows for
      another important result.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          (Uniqueness of Coefficients) Two power series centered at
          the same point are equal if an only if every coefficient is
          equal.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Assume there is an equation of power series. 
      </p>
      <me>
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (x-\alpha)^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n
        (x-\alpha)^n
      </me>
      <p>
        The coefficients are determined by the derivatives. But the
        functions are the same, so they must have the same derivatives
        at <m>\alpha</m>. Therefore, both <m>b_n</m> and <m>c_n</m>
        must be calculated by <m>\frac{f^{(n)}(\alpha)}{n!}</m>, hence
        <m>b_n = c_n</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      Uniqueness of coefficients is very important for doing algebra
      with series. If two series are equal, I can go directly to the 
      equality of each of the coefficients to get explicit equations.
      Curiously, since all the coefficients are determined by the
      derivatives at the centre point, this means that the derivatives
      at the centre point encode the entire behaviour of the function
      (inside the radius of convergence). This is a surprising
      result, since functions can have a wide range of behaviours far
      away from their centre points.

      I will calculate the Taylor series for a number of common
      functions. 
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-taylor-series1">
      <statement>
        <p>
          I start with the most important function in calculus:
          <m>e^x</m>. The derivatives of <m>e^x</m> are just
          <m>e^x</m>. If I choose <m>\alpha=0</m> as the centre point,
          then all these derivatives evaluate to <m>1</m>. Then I can
          write the series. 
          <me>
            e^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!}x^n = 1 + x +
            \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^4}{24} +
            \frac{x^5}{120} + \ldots
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          I can check that the radius of convergence for this series
          is <m>R = \infty</m>, so this is an expression for
          <m>e^x</m> which works for all real numbers.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The previous example finally allows for the proper definition of
      the exponential function. For <m>r = \frac{a}{b}</m> a rational
      number, <m>a^r = \sqrt[b]{x^a}</m>, which was well understood.
      But if <m>r</m> is irrational, I previously had no idea what
      <m>a^r</m> actually was nor how to calculate it. I worked on
      an unjustified assumption that the exponential function
      <m>e^x</m> was well defined for irrational numbers. Now,
      however, I can use this series. The value of <m>e^{\pi}</m>,
      which was completely opaque and mysterious before, is now given
      by a series.
    </p>
    <me>
      e^{\pi} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\pi^n}{n!} = 1 + \pi +
      \frac{\pi^2}{2} + \frac{\pi^3}{6} + \frac{\pi^4}{24} +
      \frac{\pi^5}{120} + \ldots
    </me>
    <p>
      Other important properties of the exponential function can be
      calculated from the series. I'll differentiate the series.
      (I use a shift in the series in the last step.)
    </p>
    <me>
      \frac{d}{dx} e^x = \frac{d}{dx} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!}
      x^n = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n!} n x^{n-1} =
      \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(n-1)!} x^{n-1} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty
      \frac{1}{n!} x^n = e^x
    </me>

      This recovers the fact that the exponential function is its own
      derivative.

          I look for a general pattern. Here, there is a factorial
          building in the numerator, an exponent in the denominator,
          and a alternating sign. I carefully match with the index to
          get the pattern.

      I want to point out one particularly useful technique from these
      examples, since this technique may be important for the
      activities and the assignments. For the series for
      <m>e^{x^2}</m>, I used an existing series and composition,
      putting <m>x^2</m> inside the series for <m>e^x</m>. This
      doesn't produce taylor series for all compositions, but it can
      be particularly helpful in certain places. For example, I could
      calculate a series for <m>sin(x^3)</m> by inputing <m>x^3+1</m>
      for the variable in the series for sine.
    </p>
    <me>
      \sin(x^3) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!}
      (x^3)^{2n+1} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} x^{6n+3}
    </me>
    <p>
      When I use this technique, be aware that the radius of
      convergence can change via the composition. It may be necessary
      to recalculate the radius of convergence, and make use of
      techniques I discussed in <xref
      ref="subsection-series-patterns-exponents" />. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, a very observant reader may have noticed that for the
      series for <m>\ln x</m> and <m>\frac{1}{x^2}</m>, the radius of
      convergence was exactly the distance to the edge of the
      convential domain. There is a theorem, which I won't get into
      here, which states that this situation is what should be
      expected (under some reasonable conditions). I will still ask
      you to calculate radii of convergence, but you should expect,
      for most series, that the radius of convergence should be the
      distance to the nearest undefined point (or infinite if there
      are no undefined points).
