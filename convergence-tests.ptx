  <title>Convergence Tests</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      As I discussed in <xref ref="section-values-of-series" />, when
      working with  series, the most pressing problem is convergence.
      I need to know if a series converges before I can do anything
      else with is. Therefore, mathematicians have devised many ways
      to test a series for convergence. I have already presented the
      test for divergence in <xref
      ref="proposition-test-for-divergence" />.  That test was the
      first of many.  In this section, I will present several more
      ways to test a series for convergence.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-comparison">
    <title>Comparison on Series</title>
    <p>
      The first couple of tests are comparison tests. For these test,
      I can determine the convergence of a series by comparing it to a
      series that is known to converge or diverge. The most important
      series for comparison are the geometric series (defined in <xref
      ref="definition-geometric-series" />) and the <m>\zeta</m>
      series (defined in <xref ref="definition-zeta-series" />). There
      are two main types of comparison: direct and asymptotic.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these comparisons, and in series in general, there are a
      comple of conventions for using infinity in comparison. In these
      conventions, please remember that infinity is not a number and I
      don't do arithmetic with it. These conventions are,
      non-the-less, useful for stating the comparison theorems. The
      conventions simply say that for any real number, it is
      permissible to write <m>-\infty \lt \alpha \lt \infty</m>. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          (Direct Comparison) Let <m>\{a_n\}</m> and <m>\{b_n\}</m> be
          the terms of two infinite series. Then an inequality of the
          terms implies an inequality of the series. 
        </p>
        <me>
          a_n \leq b_n \ \ \forall n \in \NN \implies
          \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \leq \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n
        </me>
        <p>
          In addition, let <m>a_n</m> and <m>b_n</m> be positive for
          all <m>n \in \NN</m> (and still assume <m>a_n \leq b_n</m>).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>\sum b_n</m> is convergent, since the sum
              <m>\sum a_n</m> is smaller, it must also be
              convergent.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>\sum a_n</m> is divergent, since the sum <m>\sum
              b_n</m> is larger, so it must also be divergent.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Here are some comparison examples using direct comparison.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-convergence1">
      <statement>
        <me>
          \sum_{n=3}^\infty \frac{1}{n-2}
        </me>
        <p>
          The terms <m>\frac{1}{n-2}</m> are larger that
          <m>\frac{1}{n}</m> and the harmonic series <m>\sum
          \frac{1}{n}</m> is divergent, so this series is also
          divergent.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="example-convergence2">
      <statement>
        <me>
          \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{3^n + 4n + 1}
        </me>
        <p>
          The terms <m>\frac{1}{3^n + 4n + 1}</m> are smaller that
          <m>\frac{1}{3^n}</m>. These terms <m>\frac{1}{3^n}</m> are
          the terms of a geometric series with common ratio
          <m>\frac{1}{3}</m>, which converges. Therefore, this series
          converges.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="example-convergence3">
      <statement>
        <me>
          \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n+1}{n^2}
        </me>
        <p>
          The terms <m>\frac{n+1}{n^2}</m> are larger than
          <m>\frac{1}{n}</m>. The latter are the terms of the
          divergent harmonic series, so this series diverges.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="example-convergence4">
      <statement>
        <me>
          \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{2^n}{n!}
        </me>
        <p>
          For <m>n \geq 4</m>, I can make this comparison. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \frac{2^n}{n!} = \frac{2}{1} \frac{2}{2} \frac{2}{3}
          \ldots \leq \frac{2}{3} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n-3} =
          \frac{16}{3} \frac{1}{2^n} 
        </me>
        <p>
          Therefore, the terms of this series are smaller than the
          terms of a geometric series with common
          ratio <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>, which converges. Therefore, this
          series also converges (and converges to <m>e^2</m>, as it
          happens).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="example-convergence4" />, the comparison <m>a_n
      \leq b_n</m> was only true for <m>n \geq 4</m> instead of all
      <m>n \in \NN</m>. This is typical and perfectly acceptable; for
      everything involving series other than calculating the exact
      value, I only need to consider the long term behaviour. For
      comparison, it is enough that <m>a_n \lt b_n</m> for all
      <m>n</m> past some finite fixed value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second type of comparison is asymptotic comparison.  I often
      prefer using asymptotic comparison because I  don't actually
      have to calculate the inequalities to apply the comparison.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          (Asymptotic Comparison) Let <m>a_n,b_n \geq 0</m> be the
          terms of two series. Assume that <m>a_n \geq 0</m> and
          <m>b)n \geq 0</m>. If <m>a_n</m> and <m>b_n</m> have the
          same asymptotic order (in the variable <m>n</m>), then the
          two series
        </p>
        <me>
          \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \hspace{1cm} \text{ and }
          \hspace{1cm} \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n
        </me>
        <p>
          have the same convergence behaviour: either they both
          converge or they both diverge.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="example-convergence1" />, I could have simply
      said that <m>\frac{1}{n-2}</m> is asymptotically the same order
      as <m>\frac{1}{n}</m>. The same is true for
      <m>\frac{n+1}{n^2}</m> in <xref ref="example-convergence3" />.
      I'll do one new example as well. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          As an example for both asymptotic comparison and conditional
          convergence, here are three alternating series. They are
          all convergent by the alternating series test. Comparison
          to geometric series or a <m>\zeta</m> series is used to
          check their absolute convergence.
        </p>
        <me>
          \sum_{n=3}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n^6 + n^4 - 3n - 1} 
        </me>
        <p>
          This series is absolutely convergent by asymptotic comparison to
          <m>\frac{1}{n^6}</m>.
        </p>
        <me>
          \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n \arctan n}{n^2} 
        </me>
        <p>
          This series is absolutely convergent by asymptotic
          comparison to <m>\frac{1}{n^2}</m>.
        </p>
        <me>
          \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{\ln n} 
        </me>
        <p>
          This series is analyzed by 
          asymptotic comparison to <m>\frac{1}{\ln n}</m>. This series
          with terms <m>\frac{1}{\ln n}</m> satisfies <m>\frac{1}{\ln
          n} \gt \frac{1}{n}</m>, which does that it is divergent by
          direct comparison. The asymptotic order of
          <m>\frac{(-1)^n}{\ln n}</m> is that of a divergent series,
          so the series with absolute value diverges, meaning that the
          series is only conditionally convergent. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This last series is a good examply of what it is necessary
          to assume the terms are positive in asymptotic comparison.
          If the terms can also be negative, then two series can have
          the same asymptotic order but not the same convergence
          behaviour: the series with terms <m>\frac{(-1)^m}{\ln n}</m>
          converges but the series with terms <m>\frac{1}{\ln n}</m>
          diverges. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-integral-test">
    <title>The Integral Test</title>
    <p>
      Now I'm going to move on to direct tests instead of convergence
      tests. The first test is the integral test. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          (Integral Test) If a series has positive terms and <m>a_n =
          f(n)</m> for <m>f</m> an integrable function, then the
          series is convergent if and only if the following improper
          integral is convergent.
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_1^\infty f(x) dx
        </me>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Note that the integral and the resulting series will sum to
      different numbers: this test doesn't calculate the value of the
      sum. It just tells whether the sum is convergent by comparing it
      to an improper integral.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          As promised in <xref ref="definition-zeta-series" />, the
          integral tests allows m to prove the that
          <m>\zeta</m> series converges if and only if <m>p>1</m>. Let
          me write the corresponding improper integral in three cases.
          First, when <m>p=1</m>. In this 
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x} dx = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty}
          \ln x \Bigg|_1^\infty = \infty 
        </me>
        <p>
          This integral diverges, so the <m>\zeta</m> seris also
          diverges for <m>p=1</m>. Now consider any <m>p \lt 1</m>.
          When <m>p \lt 1</m>, <m>n^p \lt m</m>, so <m>\frac{1}{n^p}
          \gt \frac{1}{n}</m>. Since I already proved divergence for
          <m>p=1</m> and the terms are large here, direct comparison
          proves that the <m>\zeta</m> series diverges for  <m>p \lt
          1</m>.  Finally, I'll do the integral when <m>p \gt 1</m>.
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^p} dx = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty}
          \frac{1}{(1-p) x^{p-1}} \Bigg|_1^a = \lim_{a \rightarrow
          \infty} \frac{1}{(1-p)a} + \frac{1}{p-1} = \frac{1}{p-1} 
        </me>
        <p>
          This integral converges, showing that the <m>\zeta</m> series
          converges when <m>p \gt 1</m>.

    <title>Testing Strategies</title>
    <p>
      There are many approaches to testing the convergence of a
      series: looking at partial sums, testing for divergence,
      comparison, asymptotic comparison, the alternating series test,
      the integral test, the ratio test, and the root test. It is
      difficult to know where to start and which tests or techniques
      to use. Here are some pointers and strategies.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Looking at a series for asymptotic order is often the
          easiest first step. The main comparisons are with
          geometric series and <m>\zeta</m>-series.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using the test for divergence is also often an easy first
          step. If the terms do not tend to <m>0</m>, the series
          cannot converge. Remember that this can only prove
          divergence, not convergence. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If the series is an alternating series, the alternating
          series test is likely the easiest approach, since the limit
          of the terms is the only calculation needed. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The integral test is often the best approach if the series
          involves transcendental functions, such as exponentials,
          logarithms or trigonometric functions. These functions can
          be difficult to handle with the other methods for series,
          which often are focused on discrete methods. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The ratio test is often the best approach when the terms
          involve factorials. It is also very useful for terms
          which have the index in the exponent.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The root test is rarely used. It also helps when the
          index is in the exponent, but most of those cases can also
          be done with the ratio test. There are a few rare cases
          where the root test is by far the best approach. 
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A final important observation is that convergence only cares
      about the long-term behaviour of the series. Any finite pieces
      at the start are negligible. This is a nice observation for
      many of the tests: comparisons only need to work eventually,
      integrals can be taken on <m>[a,\infty)</m> for some <m>a>0</m>,
      and a series which eventually becomes an alternating series can
      use the alternating series test.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For an extreme example, consider this series.
        </p>
        <me>
          \sum_{n=1}^{10^{300}} (n^2 +n)^{75} + \sum_{n=10^{300} +
          1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}
        </me>
        <p>
          The first <m>10^{300}</m> terms of this series are enormous
          numbers and their sum is simply ridiculous. However, the
          series is eventually is a <m>\zeta</m>-series with
          <m>p=2</m>, which converges. Therefore, this sum is finite.
          The ridiculous number I get from the first <m>10^{300}</m>
          terms is very, very large, but certainly finite. Any very,
          very large number is negligible when asking about infinity.

          This is an alternating series. The limit of the terms is

          This is an alternating series. The limit of the terms is
          zero, so
          the alternating series test gives convergence. In addition,
          the absolute value of the terms is <m>\frac{n}{n^3+4}</m>
          which is asymptotically equivalent to <m>\frac{1}{n^2}</m>.
          These are the terms of a <m>\zeta</m> series with

          It seems that comparison should be helpful with a series of
          this type. However, the inequality shows that this series
          is asymptotically between the harmonic series and the other
          convergent <m>p</m> series. In comparison, it's slightly
          larger than a convergent series and slightly smaller than a
          divergent series, which is entirely unhelpful. This
          frustration is not uncommon with comparison; often, the

          There is an interesting comparison argument which I can use
          to tackle this difficult example. The derivative of tangent
          is <m>\sec^2 x</m>. Since <m>\sec x</m> is always <m>>1</m>
          or <m>\lt -1</m>, I can conclude that <m>\sec^2x > 1</m>.
          That is, the slope of tangent is always larger than 1. Since
          <m>\tan 0 = 0</m>, that means that near the origin, <m>\tan
          x > x</m>.  Equivalently, for large <m>n</m>, <m>\tan
          \frac{1}{n} > \frac{1}{n}</m>. This allows me to compare the
          series to the harmonic series: the terms are larger than the
          harmonic series and the harmonic series diverges, so this
          series also diverges.
