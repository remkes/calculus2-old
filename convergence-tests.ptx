  <title>Convergence Tests</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      When we are using a series, the most pressing problem is
      convergence. We want to work with actual values, but we are
      only guaranteed those values when the series converge.
      Therefore, mathematicians have devised many ways to test a
      series for convergence. We already have the test for
      divergence. In this section, we will present several more ways
      to test a series for convergence.

    <proposition>

        <p>
          (Direct Comparison) Let <m>\{a_n\}</m> and <m>\{b_n\}</m> be
          the terms of two infinite series. Then an inequality of the
          terms implies an inequality of the series.

                If <m>\sum b_n</m> is convergent, since the sum

      <statement>
        <p>
          Here are some comparison examples.
          <me>
            \sum_{n=3}^\infty \frac{1}{n-2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The terms <m>\frac{1}{n-2}</m> are larger that
          <m>\frac{1}{n}</m> and the harmonic series <m>\sum
          \frac{1}{n}</m> is divergent, so this series is also
          divergent.
          <me>
            \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{3^n + 4n + 1}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The terms <m>\frac{1}{3^n + 4n + 1}</m> are smaller that
          <m>\frac{1}{3^n}</m>. These term <m>\frac{1}{3^n}</m> are
          the terms of a geometric series with common ratio
          <m>\frac{1}{3}</m>, which converges. Therefore, this series
          converges.
          <me>
            \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n+1}{n^2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The terms <m>\frac{n+1}{n^2}</m> are larger than
          <m>\frac{1}{n}</m>. The latter are the terms of the
          divergent harmonic series, so this series diverges.
          <me>
            \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{2^n}{n!}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          For <m>n \geq 4</m> we have
          <me>
            \frac{2^n}{n!} = \frac{2}{1} \frac{2}{2} \frac{2}{3}
            \ldots \leq \frac{2}{3} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n-4}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, we can compare to a geometric series with common
          ratio <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>, which converges. Therefore, this
          series also converges (and converges to <m>e^2</m>, as it
          happens).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      As the last paranthetical comment hinted, comparison doesn't
      actually give the value of the series. These comparison
      arguments are very useful for determining convergence and
      divergence, but they don't calculate exact values. Also, in the
      last example the comparison only held for <m>n \geq 4</m>
      instead of all <m>n \in \NN</m>. This is typical and perfectly
      acceptable; for everything involving series other than
      calculating the exact value, we only need to consider the long
      term behaviour. For comparison, it is enough that <m>a_n \lt
      b_n</m> for all <m>n</m> past some finite fixed value.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the exact comparisons listed above, we can also
      compare asymptotically. Asymptotic comparison is particularly
      useful, since we don't actually have to calculate the
      inequalities.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          (Asymptotic Comparison) Let <m>a_n,b_n \geq 0</m> be the
          terms of two series. If <m>a_n</m> and <m>b_n</m> have the
          same asymptotic order (in the variable <m>n</m>), then the
          two series
          <me>
            \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \hspace{1cm} \text{ and }
            \hspace{1cm} \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n
          </me>
          have the same convergence behaviour: either they both
          converge or they both diverge.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="example-convergence" />, we could have simply
      said that <m>\frac{1}{n-2}</m> is asymptotically the same order
      as <m>\frac{1}{n}</m>, and likewsie for <m>\frac{n+1}{n^2}</m>.
      Asymptotic comparison is often easier since we don't need to
      explicitly construct the necessary inequality.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          As an example for both asymptotic comparison and conditional
          convergence, here are three alternating series. They are
          all convergent by the alternating series test. Comparison
          to geometric series or a <m>\zeta</m> series is used to
          check their absolute convergence.

        <p>
          In the last comparision, <m>\frac{1}{\ln n} >
          \frac{1}{n}</m>, so the asymptotic order of
          <m>\frac{(-1)^n}{\ln n}</m> is that of a divergent series,
          growing faster than the harmonic series.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-integral-test">
    <title>The Integral Test</title>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          (Integral Test) If a series has positive terms and <m>a_n =
          f(n)</m> for <m>f</m> an integrable function, then the
          series is convergent if and only if the following improper

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-testing-strategies">
    <title>Testing Strategies</title>
    <p>
      There are many approaches to testing the convergence of a
      series: looking at partial sums, testing for divergence,
      comparison, asymptotic comparison, the alternating series test,
      the integral test, the ratio test, and the root test. It is
      difficult to know where to start and which tests or techniques
      to use. Here are some pointers and strategies to help you.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Looking at a series for asymptotic order is often the
            easiest first step. The main comparisons are with
            geometric series and <m>\zeta</m>-series.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Using the test for divergence is also often an easy first
            step. If the terms do not tend to <m>0</m>, the series
            cannot converge.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the series is an alternating series, the alternating
            series test is likely the easiest approach.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The integral test is often the best approach if the series
            involves complicated functions, such as exponentials,
            logarithms or trigonometric functions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The ratio test is often the best approach when the terms
            involve factorials. It is also very useful for terms
            which have the index in the exponent.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The root test is rarely used. It also helps when the
            index is in the exponent, but most of those cases can also
            be done with the ratio test.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      A final important observation is that convergence only cares
      about the long-term behaviour of the series. Any finite pieces
      at the start are negligible. This is a nice observation for
      many of the tests: comparisons only need to work eventually,
      integrals can be taken on <m>[a,\infty)</m> for some <m>a>0</m>,
      and a series which eventually becomes an alternating series can
      use the alternating series test.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For an extreme example, consider this series:
          <me>
            \sum_{n=1}^{10^{300}} (n^2 +n)^{75} + \sum_{n=10^{300} +
            1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The first <m>10^{300}</m> terms of this series are enormous
          numbers and their sum is simply ridiculous. However, the
          series is eventually is a <m>\zeta</m>-series with
          <m>p=2</m>, which converges. Therefore, this sum is finite.
          The ridiculous number we get from the first <m>10^{300}</m>
          terms is very, very large, but certainly finite. Any very,
          very large number is negligible when asking about infinity.

          It seems that comparison should be helpful with a series of
          this type. However, the inequality shows that this series
          is asymptotically between the harmonic series and the other
          convergent <m>p</m> series. In comparison, it's slightly
          larger than a convergent series and slightly smaller than a
          divergent series, which is entirely unhelpful.

          This limit is 1, so the test is inconclusive. Instead of
          using the root test, look at the limit of the terms. That

          diverge by the test for divergence.

          There is an interesting comparison argument which we can use
          to tackle this difficult example. The derivative of tangent
          is <m>\sec^2 x</m>. Since <m>\sec x</m> is always <m>>1</m>
          or <m>\lt -1</m>, we have <m>\sec^2x > 1</m>. That is, the
          slope of tangent is always larger than 1. Since <m>\tan 0 =
          0</m>, that means that near the origin, <m>\tan x > x</m>.
          Equivalently, for large <m>n</m>, <m>\tan \frac{1}{n} >
          \frac{1}{n}</m>. This allows us to compare our series to
          the harmonic series: our terms are larger than the harmonic
          series and the harmonic series diverges, so this series also
          diverges.
