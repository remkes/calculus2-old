    <title>Derivatives of Loci</title>
    <p>
      In Calculus I, I mostly calculated slopes of tangent lines to
      graphs of functions. Graphs are loci of the form <m>y =
      f(x)</m>, and <m>f^\prime(x)</m> gave us the slope of the
      tangent line. For arbitrary loci in <m>\RR^2</m>, such as the
      conics, tangent lines can also be defined. I need to define a
      refinement of the derivative techniques to find their slopes,
      since most loci are not graphs of functions. The new technique
      is implicit differentiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I know how to differentiate functions, I will
      <em>pretend</em> that a locus is (at least locally) a graph of
      a function. In a locus of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, I will pretend
      that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>. I will the use this
      pretense to differentiate the expression of the locus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Differentiating expression in <m>x</m> is easy: I just
      differentiate. Differentiating expressions in <m>y</m> (or with
      both variables) needs to account for the fact that I am
      pretending <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>. If I
      differentiate <m>y^2</m>, I have to treat it as a composition:
      some function <m>y(x)</m> which is the inside function, then
      then the function square <m>(y(x))^2</m> as the outside. As a
      composition, this is always a chain rule calculation. I get
      <m>2y</m> as the derivative of the outside, but I need to
      multiply by <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>, the derivative of the inside.
      I don't know what this is, so I just leave it as
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>. I'll eventually solve for this, since
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is, in fact, precisely what we want: the
      slope of the tangent line to the locus.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Take the locus of <m>x^4 + y^4 = 16</m>, as in <xref
          ref="figure-implicit-example" />. I will pretend
          that <m>y</m> is locally a function of <m>x</m>. Any
          expressions in <m>x</m> we differentiate normally. For
          expressions in <m>y</m>, we use the <em>chain rule</em>, due
          to the pretense that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>.
          Therefore, <m>y^4</m> has a derivative of the outside
          (<m>4y^3</m>) and a derivative of the inside
          (<m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>). Then I solve for
          <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.

          For any point <m>(x,y)</m> on this locus, the slope of the
          tangent at that point is given by the expression
          <m>\frac{-x^3}{y^3}</m>. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>
            The slope is <m>0</m> at the point <m>(0, 2)</m>. 
          </p></li>
          <li><p>
            The slope is undefined at <m>(-2, 0)</m>.
          </p></li>
          <li><p>
            The slope is <m>-1</m> at <m>(\sqrt[4]{8}, \sqrt[4]{8})</m>. 
          </p></li>
          <li><p>
            The slope is <m>1</m> at <m>(\sqrt[4]{8}, -\sqrt[4]{8})</m>. 
          </p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These four points and matching tangent lines are drawn in <xref
          ref="figure-implicit-example" />.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      In the example, the slope wasn't defined everywhere. The slope
      approaches vertical near the undefined point <m>(\pm
      -2, 0)</m>; this makes sense, since a vertical line has
      no slope. This is also the point where the assumption, that
      <m>y</m> can be expressed as a function of <m>x</m>, breaks
      down. Implicit derivatives can also fail to find slopes at
      places where a loci self-intersects or has a sharp corner. I
      will show examples of these in the <xref
      ref="section-algebraic-plane-curves" />. The key idea is that
      anywhere the assumption that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>
      fails, the process of implicit differentiation also fails.
