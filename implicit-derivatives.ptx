    <title>Derivatives of Loci</title>
    <p>
      In Calculus I, we mostly calculated slopes of tangent lines to
      graphs of functions. These are loci of the form <m>y =
      f(x)</m>, and <m>f^\prime(x)</m> gave us the slope of the
      tangent line. For arbitrary loci in <m>\RR^2</m>, such as the
      conics, tangent lines can also be defined. We need a refinement
      of our derivative techniques to find their slopes, since most
      loci are not graphs of functions. The new technique is implicit
      differentiation.

      Since we know how to differentiate functions, we will
      <em>pretend</em> that our loci are (at least locally) graphs of
      functions. In a locus of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, we will pretend
      that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>. We will the use this
      pretense to differentiate the expression of the locus.

          Take the locus of <m>x^4 + y^4 = 1</m>, as in <xref
          ref="figure-implicit-example">Figure</xref> We will pretend
          that <m>y</m> is locally a function of <m>x</m>. Any
          expressions in <m>x</m> we differentiate normally. For
          expressions in <m>y</m>, we use the <em>chain rule</em>, due
          to the pretense that <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>.
          Therefore, <m>y^4</m> has a derivative of the outside
          (<m>4y^3</m>) and a derivative of the inside
          (<m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>). Then we solve for
          <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.

        <p>
          For any point <m>(x,y)</m> on this locus, the slope of the
          tangent at that point is given by the expression
          <m>\frac{-x^3}{y^3}</m>. The slope is <m>0</m> at the point
          <m>(0, \pm \sqrt{2})</m>. The slope is undefined at <m>(\pm
          \sqrt{2}, 0)</m>. Other points on the curve include <m>(\pm
          \sqrt[4]{2}, \pm \sqrt[4]{2})</m>. Here, depending on the
          signs, the slope is <m>1</m> or <m>-1</m>. Some of these
          tangent lines are drawn in <xref
          ref="figure-implicit-example">Figure</xref>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Notice that the slope isn't defined everywhere. The slope
      approaches vertical near the undefined point <m>(\pm
      \sqrt[4]{2}, 0)</m>; this makes sense, since a vertical line has
      no slope. This is also the point where our assumption, that
      <m>y</m> can be expressed as a function of <m>x</m>, breaks
      down. Implicit derivatives can also fail to find slopes at
      places where a loci self-intersects or has a sharp corner. We
      will see examples of these in the next section.
