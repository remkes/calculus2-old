  <title>Volumes</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      An important application of integration is the calculation of
      volumes of three-dimensional objects. Maybe you wondered,
      sometime, where the various volume formulas come from: why does
      a sphere have volume <m>\frac{4\pi r^3}{4}</m>, or a cone
      <m>\frac{\pi r^2 h}{3}</m>? The oldest versions of these formlas
      were almost certainly the product of approximation and
      guessing, but now I claim to know them exactly. What is the
      proof? How are they calculated? Moveover, if there are new
      three-dimensional shapes described, techniques to calculate
      their volume are needed. This is useful in all sorts of
      designs, where designers need to know how much material the
      component will requre, or how heavy it will be (assuming density is
      known). Integrals can answer these questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This week, I'll be introducing two methods for calculating
      volume. Both methods are based on the definition of the
      integral: as the limit of a sum of approximate pieces. For each
      method, I'll develop a particular way of cutting up the object
      into 2-dimensional slices whose area is known. Then I'll
      multiply by some width <m>\Delta w</m> to get a volume for the
      slice. The sum of a number of such slices will approximate the
      area. Then I take the limit. In the limit, the sum becomes an
      integral and the width <m>\Delta w</m> becomes an infinitesimal
      <m>dw</m>.

    <title>Volumes by Cross-Sectional Slices</title>
    <p>
      The first of the two methods use cross-sectional slices. These
      are slices made by some plane as the plane moves along the
      shape. The idea is to choose an orientation for the slices such
      that they are some familiar shape: rectangles, triangles,
      circles. Then their area is known and I can setup the
      approximation system and resulting integral I described above.
      There are three pieces to the integral. Let me assume the slices
      perpendicular to the <m>x</m> axis, so that each slice is
      identified by its <m>x</m> coordinates (though, of course, this
      will all work for any axis by simply changing the variable
      name). First I have the range in <m>x</m>, <m>x \in [a,b]</m>,
      that covers the object. This will become the bounds of
      integration. Second, I have the area of the slice, <m>A(x)</m>,
      as a function of the <m>x</m> position that identifies the
      slice. This will form the integrand. Finally, I have the
      width. In the limit that defined the integral, this becomes the
      <m>dx</m> which completes the integral. Then I can write the
      integral for volume by cross-sectional slices.

          Consider a sphere of radius <m>R</m> is centered at the
          origin in <m>\RR^3</m>. Such an object is given by the
          equation <m>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2</m> as a locus in
          <m>\RR^3</m>. I will slice the sphere with vertical planes;
          the cross sections will be circles. At the front of the
          sphere, the slice is just a point. As the slices move down
          the sphere, they get larger. At the middle, the slice is a
          circle of radius <m>R</m>. Then the slices start shrinking
          down again until there is just a point at the back of the
          sphere. I'll assume the slices are perpendicular to the
          <m>x</m> axis and are identified by their <m>x</m> position
          as <m>x \in [-R,R]</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I need to know the radius of each disc, based on its
          <m>x</m> position. I could treat the maximum <m>y</m> values
          as the radius. If I set <m>z=0</m> in the locus, then <m>x^2
          + y^2 = R^2</m>, so the maximum <m>y</m> value would be <m>y
          = \sqrt{R^2 - x^2}</m>. This is the radius of the slice at
          position <m>x</m> 
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I need to set up the integral. Implicitly, of course,
          the integral is a limit of approximations. However, it is
          usually possible to go directly to setting up the integral
          using <m>dx</m> (or whatever variable indicates the position
          of the slide) as the width term. I have a range for the
          <m>x</m> positions: <m>x \in [-R,R]</m>, which forms the
          bounds for the integral. I have a circle of radius
          <m>\sqrt{R^2 - x^2}</m> at each <m>x</m> position. The area
          of this circle is <m>\pi (\sqrt(R^2 - x^2)^2 = \pi(R^2 -
          x^2)</m>. That's the area of the cross section, which is the
          function I will integrate. The width is <m>dx</m>. Those are
          all the pieces of the integral. The resulting integral is a
          reasonable polynomial integral.

      The next example will be an example of a surface of revolution.
      This is a very common construction for anything that has a
      circular cross section. The idea is to take the graph of a
      function <m>y = f(x)</m> and think of the graph sitting inside
      <m>\RR^3</m>. Then I split the graph around the <m>x</m> axis,
      like an object on a lathe. The result is an object with circular
      symmetry around the <m>x</m> axis. The radius of each slice is
      simply the function <m>f(x)</m>. This means that the integral to
      describe the volume of a surface of revoluation uses the
      function <m>\pi (f(x))^2</m> for the area of each circular
      slice.

    <me>
      V = \int_a^b \pi (f(x))^2 dx

      This construction can be done around any axis by simply changing
      the variable names in the construction.

          axis. The slices here are along the <m>y</m> axis, not the
          <m>x</m> axis; this time <m>x</m> is the radius. If I solve
          for <m>x</m> in the function, I get <m>x = a
          \sqrt{\frac{y}{h}}</m>. If this is the radius, the area is
          <m>\pi \left( a \sqrt{\frac{y}{h}} \right)^2 = \frac{\pi a^2

          The volume is finite!  Even though the Horn of Gabriel
          extends to infinity, it narrows quickly enough that it only
          contains a finite volume. These kind of strange things can
          happen with limits and infinite: an infinitely long object
          with a finite volume.

    <title>Volumes by Shells</title>
    <p>
      In the previous section, I used cross-sectional slices, slicing
      with a plane to produce the cross-section with reasonable shapes
      and known areas. However, there are other
      ways to slice up a volume. In this section, I look at the
      general method of shells. Instead of thinking of the object as a
      collection of slices, I'll think of it as a collection of 
      nested shells. You could think of the (rough) spheres that form
      an onion, or stacking Matryoshka dolls. Only now, at least in
      the limit, there are infinitely many infinitely thin shells. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The setup is the same as for slices: the shells are identified
      by some variable <m>x</m> over some range <m>x \in [a,b]</m>.
      Each shell, identified by its position <m>x</m>, has an area
      <m>A(x)</m>. In the approximation, the shells also has a width
      <m>\Delta x</m> and the approximate volume of the shell is <m>A(x)
      \Delta x</m>. In the limit, the sum becomes and integral and the
      width becomes the infinitesimal <m>dx</m>, leading to the same
      kind of integral as for cross-sectional slices. 
    </p>
    <me>
      V = \int_a^b A(x) dx 
    </me>
    <p>
      The slices were previously oriented along an axis. However,
      shells can be describes in a variety of ways. If the shells are
      radial, then perhaps <m>r</m> is the appropriate variable
      instead of <m>x</m>. Regardless of the variable name, the setup
      in the same. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thought there could be a huge variety of the types of shells
      used, I'm going to restrict to cylindrical shells.
      These are useful because the surface areas is reasonable. 
      A thin cylinder of radius <m>r</m> and height <m>h</m> could be
      cut and unrolled into a rectangle. The height of the rectangle
      is still <m>h</m>, but the width is the circumference
      <m>2\pi r</m>. Therefore, the area of the shell is <m>2\pi
      Rh</m>. Assuming that the height depends on the radius, I can
      write <m>h = h(r)</m>. Putting this into the integral gives the
      general setup for cylindrical shells.

          I'm going to try to calculate the volume of the torus using
          cylindrical shells and the radius variable <m>r</m>. To set
          this up, I'll look at the cross-section of the torus, in
          <xref ref="figure-cross-section-torus" />. 
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the bounds of the cylinrdical shell will be <m>r \in
          [b-a, b+a]</m>, since <m>a</m> is the distance to the centre
          of the small circle. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the circle on the right can be descirbe as the
          conventional locus of a circle but offset by <m>a</m> in the
          <m>r</m> axis (treating the horizontal axis here as the
          <m>r</m> axis.) If I call the vertical axis <m>h</m>, If I
          call the vertical axis <m>h</m>, this offset locus is
          <m>(r-a)^2 + h^2 = b^2</m>. I can solve for <m>h = \sqrt{b^2
          - (r-a)^2}</m>. This is only half the height of a
          cylindrical shell, since it goes both above and below, so I
          multiply by 2 to get the full height <m>2 \sqrt{b^2 -
          (r-a)^2}</m>. This lets me write the cylindrical shell
          integral for calculating the volume of the torus.

        <p>
          A substitution helps here. I change the bounds as well, as
          usual. After the substitution, the integral will split into
          two by linearity.

          I'll deal with the two integrals separately. The first
          integral can also be solved with substitution, uving <m>v =
          b^2 - u^2</m>. I've not shown the details of this
          substitution; just the resulting antiderivative.

          This integral evaluates to zero, so it will not contribute
          to the volume at all. Now I move on to the second integral.

          This needs a trig substitution, Since the variable <m>u</m>
          is in the expression <m>b^2 - u^2</m> in the square root,
          the sine substitution is appropriate.

          After the trig substitution, I need a half-angle identity to

          Then I put this (and the zero for the first integral) back

        <p>
          Therefore, the volume of a torus with major radius <m>a</m>
          and minor radius <m>b</m> is <m>2\pi^2 a^2 b</m>. As a
          curious obvservation, I can write this as <m>(2\pi a)(\pi
          b^2)</m>. The <m>2\pi a</m> factor is the circumference of
          the large circle with radius <m>a</m>, which lies at the
          center of each cross-sectional circle. The <m>\pi b^2</m>
          factor is the radius of each cross-sectional circle.
          Therefore, the torus has the same volume of a cylinder with
          height equal to this circumference and radius <m>b</m>.
