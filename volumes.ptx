  <title>Volumes</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      An important application of integration is the calculation of
      volumes of three-dimensional objects. Maybe you wondered,
      sometime, where the various volume formulas come from: why does
      a sphere have volume <m>\frac{4\pi r^3}{4}</m>, or a cube
      <m>\frac{\pi r^2 h}{3}</m>? The oldest versions of these formlas
      were almost certainly the product of approxiamation and
      guessing, but now we claim to know them exactly. What is the
      proof? How are they calculated? Moveover, if there are new
      three-dimensional shapes described, techniques to calculate
      their volume are valuable. This is useful in all sorts of
      designs, where designers need to know how much material the
      component will requre, or how heavy it will be (assuming density is
      known). Integrals can answer these questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This week, I'll be introducing two methods for calculating
      volume. Both methods are based on the definition of the
      integral: as the limit of a sum of approximate pieces. For each
      method, I'll develop a particular way fo cutting up the object
      into 2-dimensional slices whose area is known. Then I'll
      multiply by some width <m>\Delta w</m> to get a volume for the
      slice. The sum of a number of such slices will approximate the
      area. Then I take the limit. In the limit, the sum becomes an
      integral and the width <m>\Delta w</m> becomes an infinitesimal
      <m>dw</m>.

    <title>Volumes by Cross-Sectional Slices</title>
    <p>
      The first of the two methods use cross-sectional slices. These
      are slices made by some plane as the plane moves along the
      shape. The idea is to choose an orientation for the slices such
      that they are some familiar shape: rectangles, triangles,
      circles. Then their area is know and I can setup the
      approximation system and resulting integral I described above.
      There are three pieces to the integral. Let me assume the slices
      perpendicular to the <m>x</m> axis, so that each slice is
      identified by its <m>x</m> coordinates (though, of course, this
      will all work for any axis by simply changing the variable
      name). First I have the range in <m>x</m>, <m>x \in [a,b]</m>,
      that covers the object. This will become the bounds of
      integration. Second, I have the area of the slice, <m>A(x)</m>,
      as a function of the <m>x</m> position that identifies the
      slice. This will form the integrand. Finally, I hvae the
      width. In the limit that defined the integral, this becomes the
      <m>dx</m> which completes the integral. Then I can write the
      integral for volume by cross-sectional slices.

        <p>
          Consider a sphere of radius <m>R</m> is centered at the
          origin in <m>\RR^3</m>. Such an object is given by the
          equation <m>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2</m> as a locus in
          <m>\RR^3</m>. I will slice the sphere with
          vertical planes; the cross sections will be circles. At
          the front of the sphere, the slice is just a point. As the
          slices move down the sphere, they get larger. At the
          middle, the slice is a circle of radius <m>R</m>. Then the
          slices start shrinking down again until there is just a
          point at the back of the sphere. <xref
          ref="figure-slices-sphere" /> shows this process. I'll
          assume the slices are perpendicular to the <m>x</m> axis and
          are identified by their <m>x</m> position as <m>x \in
          [-R,R]</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I need to know the radius of each disc, based on its
          <m>x</m> position. I could treat the maximum <m>y</m> values
          as the radius. If I set <m>z=0</m> in the locus, then <m>x^2
          + y^2 = R^2</m>, so the maximum <m>y</m> value would be <m>y
          = \sqrt{R^2 - x^2}</m>. This is the radius of the slice at
          position <m>x</m> 
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I need to set up the integral. Implicitly, of course,
          the integral is a limit of approximations. However, it is
          usually possible to go directly to setting up the integral
          using <m>dx</m> (or whatever variable indicates the position
          of the slide) as the width term. I have a range for the
          <m>x</m> positions: <m>x \in [-R,R]</m>, which forms the
          bounds for the integral. I have a circle of radius
          <m>\sqrt{R^2 - x^2}</m> at each <m>x</m> position. The area
          of this circle is <m>\pi (\sqrt(R^2 - x^2)^2 = \pi(R^2 -
          x^2)</m>. That's the area of the cross section, which is the
          function I will integrate. The width is <m>dx</m>. Those are
          all the pieces of the integral. The resulting integral is a
          reasonable polynomial integral.

      The next example will be an example of a surface of revolution.
      This is a very common construction for anything that has a
      circular cross section. The idea is to take the graph of a
      function <m>y = f(x)</m> and think of the graph sitting inside
      <m>\RR^3</m>. Then I split the graph around the <m>x</m> axis,
      like an object on a lathe. The result is an object with circular
      symmetry around the <m>x</m> axis. The radius of each slice is
      simply the function <m>f(x)</m>. This means that the integral to
      describe the volume of a surface of revoluation uses the
      function <m>\pi (f(x))^2</m> for the area of each circular
      slice.

    <title>Volumes by Shells</title>
    <p>
      In the previous section, I used cross-sectional slices, slicing
      with a plane to produce the cross-section with reasonable shapes
      and known ares. However, there are other
      ways to slice up a volume. In this section, I look at the
      general method of shells. Instead of thinking of the object as a
      collection of slices, I'll think of it as a collection of 
      nested shells. You could think of the (rough) spheres that form
      an onion, or stacking Matryoshka dolls. Only now, at least in
      the limit, there are infinitely many infinitely thin shells. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The setup is the same as for slices: the shells are identified
      by some variable <m>x</m> over some range <m>x \in [a,b]</m>.
      Each shell, identified by its position <m>x</m>, has an area
      <m>A(x)</m>. In the approximation, the shells also has a width
      <m>\Delta x</m> and the approximate volume of the shell is <m>A(x)
      \Delta x</m>. In the limit, the sum becomes and integral and the
      width becomes the infinitesimal <m>dx</m>, leading to the same
      kinf of integral as for cross-sectional slices. 
    </p>
    <me>
      V = \int_a^b A(x) dx 
    </me>
    <p>
      The slices were previously oriented along an axis. However,
      shells can be describes in a variety of ways. If the shells are
      radial, then perhaps <m>r</m> is the appropriate variable
      instead of <m>x</m>. Regardless of the variable name, the setup
      in the same. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thought there could be a huge variety of the types of shells
      used, I'm going to restrict to cylindrical shells.
      These are useful because the surface areas is reasonable. 
      A thin cylinder of radius <m>r</m> and height <m>h</m> could be
      cut and unrolled into a rectangle. The height of the rectangle
      is still <m>h</m>, but the width is the circumference
      <m>2\pi r</m>. Therefore, the area of the shell is <m>2\pi
      Rh</m>. Assuming that the height depends on the radius, I can
      write <m>h = h(r)</m>. Putting this into the integral gives the
      general setup for cylindrical shells.

          An interesting example is the calculation of the volume of a

          centre of the torus to the centre of any cross-sectional
          circle, and a smaller radius <m>b</m>, which is the radius
          of any cross-sectional circle. A torus is show in <xref

          I'm going to try to calculate the volume of the torus using
          cylindrical shells and the radius variable <m>r</m>. To set
          this up, I'll look at the cross-section of the torus, in
          <xref ref="figure-cross-section-torus" />. 
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the bounds of the cylinrdical shell will be <m>r \in
          [b-a, b+a]</m>, since <m>a</m> is the distance to the centre
          of the small circle. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the circle on the right can be descirbe as the
          convnetional locus of a circle but ofset by <m>a</m> in the
          <m>r</m> axis (treating the horizontal axis here as the
          <m>r</m> axis.) 
          If I call the vertical axis <m>h</m>, If I call the vertical
          axis <m>h</m>, this offset locus is <m>(r-a)^2 +
          h^2 = b^2</m>. I can solve for <m>h = \sqrt{b^2 -
          (r-a)^2}</m>. This is only half the height of a cylindrical
          shell, since it goes both above and below, so I multiply by
          2 to get the full height <m>2 \sqrt{b^2 - (r-a)^2}</m>. This
          lets me write the cylindrical shell integral for calculating
          the volume of the torus.

          A substitution helps here. I change the bounds as well, as

          I'll deal with the two integral separately. The first
          integral can also be solve with substitution, uving <m>v =
          b^2 - u^2</m>. I've not shown the details of this

          Therefore, the volume of a torus with major radius <m>a</m>
          and minor radius <m>b</m> is <m>2\pi^2 a^2 b</m>. As a
          curious obvservation, I can write this as <m>(2\pi a)(\pi
          b^2)</m>. The <m>2\pi a</m> factor is the circumference of
          the large circle with radius <m>a</m>, which lies at the
          center of each cross-sectional circle. The <m>\pi b^2</m>
          factor is the radius of each cross-sectional circle.
          Therefore, the torus has the same volume of a cylinder with
          height equal to this circumference and radius <m>b</m>.
