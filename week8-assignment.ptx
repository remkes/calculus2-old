        The horn of Gabriel is the surface of revolution formed by
        rotating the graph of <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> about the
        <m>x</m> axis on the domain <m>[1,\infty)</m>. In the videos
        and notes, I showed that this horn has finite volume, even
        though it is infinitely long. Now, instead of <m>f(x) =
        \frac{1}{x}</m>, repeat the construction for <m>f(x) =
        \frac{1}{x^2}</m> (domain  <m>[1,\infty]</m>) and <m>f(x) =
        \frac{1}{x \ln x}</m> (domain <m>[e, \infty</m>) and show
        that the volume is again finite in both these cases. (8)

        Consider the surface of revolution formed by rotating <m>f(x)
        = \frac{x^3}{7}</m> about the <m>y</m> axis, for 
        <m>x \in [0,3]</m>. Calculate the volume that sits between
        this surface and the <m>xy</m> plane, using cylindrical
        shells. (6)

        Consider the surface of revoluation formed by rotating <m>f(x)
        = 2 + \frac{1}{4} \sin x</m> about the <m>y</m> axis, for <m>x
        \in [0, 6\pi]</m>. Calculate the volume that sites between
        this surface adn the <m>xy</m> plane, using cylindrical
        shells. (6)
