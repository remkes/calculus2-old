        Consider a tilted pyramid with a base consisting of a <m>3
        \times 3</m> square, height <m>5</m>, and apex located directly
        above one of the corners of the base, instead of centred above
        the base (hence <sq>tilted</sq>). Calculate the volume of this
        pyramid using integration and horizontal slices. (6)

        Calculate the volume of the surface of revolution formed by
        rotating <m>f(x) = x^{\frac{-14}{3}}</m>, <m>x \in [1, 27]</m>
        around the <m>x</m> axis. (4)

        Describe three ways of using slices or shells to setup a
        volume integral to calculate the volume of a sphere. (You do
        not need to actually calculate anything here, just describe
        the setup. You do not need to write down, let alone calculate,
        any integrals.) (4)
