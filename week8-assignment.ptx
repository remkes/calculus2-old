        The horn of Gabriel is the surface of revolution formed by
        rotating the graph of <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> about the
        <m>x</m> axis on the domain <m>[1,\infty)</m>. In the videos
        and notes, I showed that this horn has finite volume, even
        though it is infinitely long. Now, instead of <m>f(x) =
        \frac{1}{x}</m>, repeat the construction for <m>f(x) =
        \frac{1}{x^2}</m> (domain  <m>[1,\infty)</m>) and <m>f(x) =
        \frac{1}{x \ln x}</m> (domain <m>[e, \infty)</m>) and show
        that the volume is again finite in both these cases. (8)

        Consider the surface of revolution formed by rotating <m>f(x)
        = \frac{x^3}{7}</m> about the <m>y</m> axis, for 
        <m>x \in [0,3]</m>. Calculate the volume that sits below
        surface and above the horizontal plane, using cylindrical
        shells. (6)

        Consider the surface of revoluation formed by rotating <m>f(x)
        = 2 + \frac{1}{4} \sin x</m> about the <m>y</m> axis, for <m>x
        \in [0, 6\pi]</m>. Calculate the volume that sites between
        below surface and above the horizontal plane, using cylindrical
        shells. (6)

        In trying to find the volume of a cylinder, many approaches
        are possible. Describe three different ways to slice up the
        cylinder (using either straight slices or shells). You don't
        need to do any calculations or integrals here; just describe,
        in words and/or drawings, the three ways of breaking up the shape
        and the resulting shape of the slices. (4)
