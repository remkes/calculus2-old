        Assyme that <m>g(x) \neq 0</m> on <m>[a, \infty)</m>. What
        does asymptotic analysis have to say about the following
        integral. (4) 
        <me>
          \int_a^\infty \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} dx

        Imagine a pyramid-like structure where each horizontal cross
        section is a square and the side length of the square is
        <m>f(x) = \sqrt{100 - x^2}</m> where <m>x 
        \in [0,10]</m> is the height, in metres. Find the volume of
        such an object. (8)

        Find the volume of a cone with flare angle
        <m>\frac{\pi}{4}</m> and height <m>4m</m> after a vertical
        cyinder of radius <m>1.5</m>m has been removed from the middle
        of the cone. (The axis of the cylinder is the same as the axis
        of the cone.) (8)
