      In this lecture, we're going to introduce a new class of
      functions: the hyperbolic functions. One might wonder why we
      didn't do this earlier in Calculus I, when we talked about the
      universe of functions. The only reason to delay it to Calculus
      II is time; Calculus I is very full, and hyperbolics aren't
      necessary for any of the material. Therefore, we have this
      isolated section on a new family of functions.

    <p>
      The basic idea for hyperbolic functions comes from the
      construction of trigonometric functions. Recall how we defined
      the sine and cosine functions, as shown in <xref
      ref="figure-trig-definition">Figure</xref>. For a circle with
      radius one, angle (in radians) can be <em>defined</em> to be the
      arc length of the inscribed arc or, equivalently, twice the
      shadded area. Then the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates of a
      point on the edge of the unit circle, dependant on the angle,
      are given by the cosine and sine functions, respectively. The
      important observation is that there is an <em>natural,
      intrinsic</em> definition of angle, and that the trigonometric
      functions give cartesian ccoordinates based on that intrinsic
      angle.
    </p>

      <image width="100%" source="images/figure02" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      The unit circle is the locus of the equation <m>x^2 + y^2 =
      1</m>. If we change this very slightly to <m>x^2 - y^2 = 1</m>,
      then we have the unit hyperbola instead.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          As seen in the shaded region in <xref
          ref="figure-hyperbolic-definition">Figure</xref>,
          <term>hyperbolic angle</term> is defined to be the area
          inscribed by the hyperbolic angle. Hyperbolic cosine and
          sine are the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates of a point on
          the hyperbola as functions of hyperbolic angle.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Recall that the trigonometric angle is bounded between 0 and
      <m>2\pi</m>. Hyperbolic angle is unbounded: as we keep moving
      the point up the hyperbola, the inscribed area grows to
      infinity. This also means that hyperbolic functions are
      <em>not</em> periodic.

  <subsection xml:id="hyperbolic-identities">
    <title>Hyperbolic Identities</title>
    <p>
      The fundamental trigonometric idetity is <m>\sin^2 \theta +
      \cos^2 \theta =1</m>, which comes from the fact that these are
      <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates and the circle is the locus
      <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>. For the hyperbolics, the locus is now
      <m>x^2 - y^2 = 1</m>, so the fundamental hyperbolic identity is
      <me>
        \cosh^2 \theta - \sinh^2 \theta = 1
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In parallel with the trigonometric functions, there are many
      other hyperbolic identities. In almost all cases, they are the
      same as the trigonometric identities excepts for differences in
      sign. I'll give two examples here; the rest are found in the
      reference materials.
      <me>
        \sinh (x+y) = \sinh x \cosh y + \cosh x \sinh y \hspace{2cm}
        \tanh^2 x = 1 - \sech^2 x
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Also in parallel with trigonometry, the remaining hyperbolic
      functions (tanh, coth, sech, csch) are defined in terms of
      hyperbolic sine and cosine. For example, since <m>\tan x =
      \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}</m>, we also have that <m>\tanh x =
      \frac{\sinh x}{\cosh x}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we can move on to the most surprising fact about
      hyperbolics, a fact that doesn't (at least at this point) have
      any parallel with trigonometry. The fact is this: hyperbolics
      are actually not new functions at all. They can be quite easily
      built out of exponentials. For the base functions <m>\sinh
      x</m> and <m>\cosh x</m>, we have
      <me>
        \cosh x = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} \hspace{1cm} \text{ and }
        \hspace{1cm} \sinh x = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this definition, the remaining four hyperbolics are defined
      in terms of exponentials as are follows.
      <md>
        <mrow>  
          \tanh x = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} \amp
          \hspace{2cm} \coth x = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{e^x -
         e^{-x}}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \sech x = \frac{2}{e^x + e^{-x}} \amp \hspace{2cm} \csch x
          = \frac{2}{e^x - e^{-x}}
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, we know the asymptotic behaviour and asymptotic
      order of the hyperbolics. <m>\cosh x</m> and <m>\sinh x</m>
      both have the same asymptotic order as <m>e^x</m>. <m>\sech
      x</m> and <m>\csch x</m> both have exponential decay to 0.
      <m>\coth x</m> and <m>\tanh x</m> both have horizontal
      asymptotes at <m>y = \pm 1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also reverse the exponential identities to gives a 
      pleasant description of the exponential function.
      <me>
        e^x = \cosh x + \sinh x
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This leads us to an interesting question: if hyperbolics relate
      both to trigonometry (in definition, form and identities) and
      exponentials, is there also a hidden connection between
      trigonometry and exponentials? This is a question we will
      return to late in the course.

  <subsection xml:id="inverse-hyperbolics">
    <title>Inverse Hyperbolics</title>
    <p>
      For trigonometry, we used the notation of <m>\arcsin x</m> for
      the inverse of <m>\sin x</m>; we will use a similar notation for
      hyperbolics. Inverses will be indicated by a <sq>arc</sq>
      prefix, so <m>\arcsinh x</m> is the inverse of the hyperbolic
      sine function.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following table summarizes the domain restrictions required
      to define the inverse hyperbolics. Since the hyperbolics are
      not periodic, these domain restrictions are much less
      restrictive than they were for trigonometric functions. Since
      the inverse switches domain and range, the resulting range in
      the table will be the domain of the inverse.

      Since the hyperbolics have exponential descripions, we expect
      that their inverses will have logarithmic descriptions. This is
      true.

      Now that we have these new functions, we'd like to know their
      integral and differential behaviour. The following derivatives
      and integrals of hyperbolic functions are all fairly easily
      determined using the exponential description.

      Again, there is a similarity in form to the trigonometric
      derivatives but with difference in sign. In particular, for
      sine and cosine, four derivatives returned us to the original
      function. For hyperbolic sine and cosine, since the derivatives
      don't introduce a negative sign, only two derivatives return us
      to the original.

      One way of thinking about exponentials, trigonometric functions
      and hyperbolics is in terms of solutions to differential
      equations. This table summarizies three of the most basic and

      Like inverse trigonometric derivatives, the results of these
      derivatives are particularly interesting because they are
      special algebraic functions which don't have algebraic
      anti-derivatives. If we reverse the direction, this means we
      need inverse hyperbolics to do the following integrals.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} dx \amp = \arcsinh x + c
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} dx \amp = \arccosh x + c
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \int \frac{1}{1 - x^2} dx \amp = \arctanh x + c \text{ or }
          \arccoth x + c

      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice the strangness with inverse hyperbolic cotangent and
      tangent. Both have the same derivatives and both solve the same
      integrals. This seems odd, since the solutions to integrals are
      unique up to a constant. The confusion is solved by realizing
      that <m>\arccoth</m> and <m>\arctanh</m> have mutually exclusive
      domains. Therefore, the <sq>or</sq> in the solution is
      appropriate: the anti-derivative is either of the two functions
      depending on your location on the real number line.
