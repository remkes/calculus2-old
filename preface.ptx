    This document containt content and activities for a blended or
    online Calculus 2 course. The course is organized into 12 weeks
    following a typical 3 month Canadian academic term. Each chapter
    (week) of the notes includes several sections of content as well
    as activities and an assignment.

    <em>Note for Winter 2020</em> Since the Winter 2020 term has been
    slightly abbreviated, only elevent weeks are present here. I have
    removed what used to be in Week 1, so the weeks start counting at
    week 2. I have also hidden a few other topics in subsequent weeks.

  <p>
    This document is not meant to stand alone; instead, it is
    designed to be the written reference material for a set of videos
    or lectures. The main purpose of the document is to be a
    record of the course content which is easier to use for reference
    than the videos. There are some examples in the main body, but
    most examples are presented as activities for the student to
    first attempt and then compare with the posted solution.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each week of the course, you are expected to watch the videos
    for the week and do the activities and assignmnets presented in
    this notes. In the activities, material labeled ``Extra
    Practice'' or ``Challenge Problems' is optional material.

  <title>Other Resources</title>
  <p>
    In addition to the notes associated to each lecture, there are a
    number of other resources which are distributed via the course
    Moodle site. These resources have been developed to assist you,
    so please make use of them.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A set of pre-calculus notes and learning modules (current
          unfinished). If you struggled with the self-assessment or
          are otherwise worried about your background mathematical
          knowledge and skills, these resources are here to help you
          learn or practice skills which are prerequisite to this
          course.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A complete formula sheet. All of the basic formulas and
          rules for calculation are included on this sheet. There are
          sections on algebra, trigonometry, derivatives and
          integrals.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A library of functions. This reference gives archetypical
          examples of all of the elementary functions that we use in
          calculus. There are also small example graphs, so that you
          can develop a visual intuition for common functions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A notation reference. Though many of the idea in the course
          have been covered in high-school mathematics, often our
          notations differ. This reference covers a number of
          notations used in the course which may be unfamiliar.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A course outcomes sheet. This was originally developed as a
          study aid for students. It summarizes the main definitions
          and concepts of the course, as well as the types of
          questions your will encounter on assignments and exams. In
          particular, it gives a guide to the material on the exam.
          If you want to know whether a definition, topic or type of
          problem might show up on the exam, consult this sheet.
          There will be nothing on the exam that isn't referenced on
          this sheet.
        </p>

  <title>Perspectives and Philosophy</title>
  <p>
    In addition to the strictly mathematical material of the course, I
    will try to share some ideas about the philosophy of mathematics,
    the aesthetics of mathematics, and how our own worldview and
    assumptions influence mathematical thought.
