  <title>Algebraic Plane Curves</title>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="section-implicit-derivatives" />, I defined implicit
    derivatives to understand tangents to loci. These implicit
    derivatives relied on the assumption that, at least locally, the
    variable <m>y</m> was a function of the variable <m>x</m>. When
    this assumption failed, the tangent line wasn't defined. So far,
    the examples had vertical tangents when the assumption failed.
    This made some sense, since a vertical line doesn't have a
    well-defined slope. However, there are a variety of ways, in
    addition to vertical tangents, that implicit derivative can fail.
    This week, I'm going to investigate the places where these
    loci don't have well defined derivatives. 
  </p>
  <p>
    First, however, I want to define a new class of loci. Doing the
    theory for this week in full generality for any loci in
    <m>\RR^2</m> isn't really feasible. I'm going to restrict loci
    with the following definition. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Another name for loci in <m>\RR^2</m> is <term>plane
        curves</term>. An <term>algebraic plane curve</term> is a
        locus where the expression is a polynomial. The
        <term>degree</term> of an algebraic plane curve is the highest
        polynomial degree involved in the equation of the curve.

    There are two classes of algebraic loci which you should be pretty
    familiar with by now.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        An algebraic plane curve of degree one is a <term>line</term>.
        There are several ways to write equations of lines, but the most
        general form is the following, where <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and
        <m>c</m> are real constants. 
      </p>
      <me>
        ax + by + c = 0 
      </me>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        An algebraic plane curve of degree two is a
        <term>conic</term>. I've already shown in Calculus 1 that all
        conics have equations of degree two (they only involve squares
        of the variable). What is new, here, is the fact that all
        algebriac plane curves of degree two are, in fact, conics.
        (I'm not going to prove this fact, just state it.) The
        forms of the equation can differ from what I've shown you
        before, but all possible forms can be manipulated into the
        equation of one of the four conics. This is another nice
        reason to put the conics in a family with a unified name. 
        The most general form of a conic is the following, where
        <m>a_1</m>, <m>a_2</m>, <m>a_3</m>, <m>a_4</m>, <m>a_5</m> and
        <m>a_6</m> are real constants. 
      </p>
      <me>
        a_1 x^2 + a_2 xy + a_3 y^2 + a_4 x + a_5 y + a_6 = 0
      </me>
      <p>
        This form does include some equations which are not familiar,
        such as <m>-4x^2 + 4xy - 2y^2 + 4x - 3y + 2 = 0</m>. This
        particular equation produces an ellipse at an angle: the major
        and minor axes are no longer oriented along the <m>x</m> or
        <m>y</m> axes. The ellipse is also not centred at the origin.
        <xref ref="figure-ellipse1" /> shows a graph of this ellipse.
        The general form, as indicated in this example, can produce
        conics with any angle of rotation or shift of position
        compared with the familiar forms centred at the origin.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Non-vertical lines have no undefined tangents, since the slope of
    the line is the slope of the tangent at all points. Conics can
    have vertical tangents, as shown in previous examples. With one
    important exception (which I'll talk about in the next section),
    vertical tangents are the only problems with tangent slopes to
    conics. However, when I consider higher degree algebraic plane
    curves, all sorts of things can happen.
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, just to show the variety of shapes, let me give you a few
    examples of interesting algebraic plane curve in degrees higher
    than two.

        This is an algebriac plane curve of degree eight, and quite a
        complicated one. It has several components, many of which
        intersect at various places. Its graph is shown in <xref

        notice that this looks somewhat like the amalgamation of one
        line and two hyperbolae.
