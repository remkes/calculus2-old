        Calculate the Taylor series for <m>f(x) = \sin (x^2 + \pi)</m>
        centred at <m>\alpha = 0</m>.  (Don't do this question by using
        the full algorithm; instead, use existing series to produce
        the new series.) (4)

        Consider the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m>. Find two
        Taylor series for <m>f</m> one centred at <m>
        \alpha = 0 </m> and one centred at <m>
        \alpha = 2</m>. What are the similarities and differences
        between the two series? What patterns do they share? (6)
