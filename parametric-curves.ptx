  <title>Parametric Curves</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We've done a fair bit of work with loci in this course and in Calculus I. Earlier in this course we talked about algebraic plane curves,
      which were the loci of polynomial equations in <m>\RR^2</m>.
      This section introduces a new way to think about curves:
      by thinking of movement along the shape.
      The movement happens with respect to a parameter,
      which we think of as time:
      as time passes, we move along the curve.
      For loci like algebraic plane curves,
      the entire curve is presented at one, as a complete object.
      For parametric curves,
      we start at a point and move along the curve in time.

          Let <m>t</m> be an indepedent variable
          (the parameter),
          which we think of as time.
          A parametric curve in <m>\RR^2</m> is a set of two functions <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m>,
          which give the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates of the curve at any point <m>t</m> in time.
          We assume that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are continuous,
          so that the curve is a connected curve.
          Often we want to refer the curve with one symbol,
          which is typically the greek letter <m>\gamma</m>.
          <me>
            \gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this is a function of <m>t</m>, we need a domain.
          Typically we will have <m>t \in [a,b]</m> for an interval.
