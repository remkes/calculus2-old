        Consider the following general integral form, where
        <m>p(x)</m> is an arbitrary polynomial. (4) 
      </p>
      <me>
        \int p(x) e^x dx 
      </me>
      <p>
        Why does integration by parts help with this type of integral?
        How many times do you have to use integration by parts to
        finish the integral?
