    <title>Zeno's Paradox</title>
    <p>
      There are three classical branches of calculus. The first two,
      derivatives and integrals, command the vast majority of the time
      and energy in most first year calculus classes. In many
      universities, these two topics are the entire course. However,
      there is a third branch of the calculus which deserves equal
      attention: infinite series.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some ways, the problem of infinite series is older than the
      problems motivating derivatives and integrals.
      Infinite series go back at least to early Greek mathematics,
      where thinkers struggled with the puzzles of infinitiy. The most
      famous of those ancient puzzles is known as Zeno's
      Paradox.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many forms of Zeno's Paradox; I will present one
      relatively common version. If you wish to travel from point
      <m>a</m> to point <m>b</m>, then first you must travel half-way.
      Having gone halfway to <m>b</m>, you must again cover half the
      remaining distance. Having gone <m>\frac{3}{4}</m> of the way
      to <m>b</m>, there is still a distance remaining, and you still
      must first cover half that distance. Repeating this process
      gives an infinite series of halves, all of which must be
      traversed to travel from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>. Since doing an
      infinite number of things is not humanly possible, you will
      never be able to reach <m>b</m>. Finally, since this holds for
      any two points <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, movement is impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously, Zeno's paradox doesn't hold, since movement is,
      indeed, possible. But Zeno's paradox has
      commanded the attention and imagination of philosophers and
      mathematicians for over 2000 years, as they struggled to deal
      with the infinity implicit in even the smallest movement.
      Infinite series is one way (though, some would argue, an
      incomplete way) of dealing with Zeno's paradox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before defining series themselves, I need to start with
      infinite sequences.

          An <term>infinite sequence</term> of real numbers is a set
          of real numbers indexed by <m>\NN</m>. The following are
          some common notations for an infinite sequence.

    </definition>
    <p>
      Before moving on to examples, I want to make one more
      definition. The most obvious way to define a sequence is by a
      direct formula, such as <m>a_n = n^2</m>, the sequence of square
      numbers. The most important non-direct method is covered by the
      next definition.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A sequence <m>\{ a_n \}</m> is called a <term>recursive
          sequence</term> is each element is determined by the
          previous element (or previous few elements). The equation
          that defined the recursive sequence is call a
          <term>recurrence relation</term>. Often a recurrence
          relation is difficult to calculate with and a direct
          description is desired. Such a descriptions is
          called the <term>closed form description</term> for the 
          recursive sequence.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Let me introduce an important change in perspective for
      sequences. Instead of thinking of <m>\NN</m> as an index, I
      can think of a sequence <m>\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> as a
      function.
    </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \amp f: \NN \rightarrow \RR \amp \amp f(n) = a_n
        </mrow>
      </md>
    <p>
      If I think of sequences as functions on <m>\NN</m>, then I can
      use all of the language of functions. In this way, sequences
      can be increasing, decreasing, monotonic, bounded above, bounded
      below and bounded. However, since the domain <m>\NN</m> is
      separated into discrete numbers, this function <m>f</m> has no
      continuity properties. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though I stated the definition for indices in <m>\NN</m>,
      I can choose another starting point.
      <m>\{a_n\}_{n=3}^\infty</m> is a sequence which starts with
      <m>a_3</m>, and <m>\{a_n\}_{n=-2}^\infty</m> is a sequences
      which starts with <m>a_{-2}</m>. Regardless of the starting
      point, sequences still always count up by 1 from the starting
      point.

    <title>Limits of Sequences</title>
    <p>
      As functions <m>\NN \rightarrow \RR</m>, sequences are not
      continuous, so I can't ask for limits at finite values.
      However, since the index <m>n \rightarrow \infty</m>, I can ask
      for the long term behaviour of the sequence.

          \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_n = L
        </me>
        <p>
          means that as <m>n</m> gets larger and larger without bound,
          <m>a_n</m> gets closer and closer to <m>n</m>. Similarly,
          the statement

          \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_n = \infty

          means that as <m>n</m> gets larger and larger without bound
          <m>a_n</m> also gets larger and larger without bound.
          Sequences with finite limits are <term>convergent</term>
          sequences, and all others (where the limit is either

      To understand limits, I can make great use of the perspective
      of sequences as functions. I know that limits of functions
      have many useful properties; all those properties transfer to
      sequences. Most importantly, for any sequences defined by a
      familiar functions, asymptotic analysis is still appropriate. The
      limits of sequences are limits at infinity, so I will use
      asymptotic analysis whenever possible. In addition, many other
      properties of sequences of functions transfer over.

          Asymptotic anlysis doesn't solve everything; some limits are

          Asymptotic analysis has trouble with this limit because the
          term inside the brackets approaches <m>1</m>. <m>1</m> to
          any power is just one, so there is an intuition that limit
          should be <m>1</m>. However, the exponent approches
          <m>\infty</m> and the term in the brackets is (at least
          slightly) larger then one. A very high power of a number
          larger than <m>1</m> should grow very large, so there is
          also an intuition that the limit should be infinite. It is
          not clear, by examining the limit, whether one of these two
          intutition is correct or whether (as is the case) the limit
          ends up between the two intuititon. This is another type of

        <p>
          One of the example sequences was the ratio of the Fibonacci
          terms. If <m>f_n</m> are the Fibonacci terms, then the ratio
          is <m>a_n = \frac{f_{n+1}}{f_n}</m>.  I can use the
          recursive definition of the sequence of Fibonacci terms:
          <m>f_{n+1} = f_{n} + f_{n-1}</m>. In the ratio <m>a_n</m>, I
          can replace the numerator with this recursive definition.
          Then some algebra lets me determine a recurivse definition
          for the <m>a_n</m>. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \frac{f_{n+1}}{f_n} = \frac{f_n}{f_n} +
          \frac{f_{n-1}}{f_n} \implies a_n = 1 +
          \frac{1}{\frac{f_n}{f_{n-1}}} \implies a_n = 1 +
          \frac{1}{a_{n-1}}
        </me>
        <p>
          Now I have a recursive definition for the sequences of
          Fibonacci ratios. Recursive definition are problematic for
          direct calculations of limits, but there is a useful trick
          for calculating these limits. Let me restate this recurvise
          definition.

          The trick is to take the limit of both sides of the

          calculate. On the right, I can use the limit laws to take
          the limit inside the various operations. Then, the limit of
          <m>a_{n-1}</m> is also the limit I want to calculate. Let me
          lable the result of this limit as <m>\phi</m>.

          Now I have an equation for the value of the limit. I proceed
          to solve the equation.

          Via the recursive definition, I've managed to calculate the
