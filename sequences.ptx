    <title>History of Sequences</title>
    <p>
      There are three classical branches of calculus. The first two,
      derivatives and integrals, command the vast majority of the time
      and energy in most first year calculus classes. In many
      universities, these two topics are the entire course. However,
      there is a third branch of the calculus which deserves equal
      attention: infinite series.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some ways, the problem of infinite series is older than the
      problems motivating derivatives and integrals. Issues of
      infinite series go back at least to early Greek mathematics,
      where thinkers struggled with the puzzle known as Zeno's
      Paradox.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many forms of Zeno's Paradox; I will present one
      relatively common version. If you wish to travel from point
      <m>a</m> to point <m>b</m>, then first you must travel half-way.
      Having gone halfway to <m>b</m>, you must again cover half the
      remaining distance. Having gone <m>\frac{3}{4}</m> of the way
      to <m>b</m>, there is still a distance remaining, and you still
      must first cover half that distance. Repeating this process
      gives an infinite series of halves, all of which must be
      traversed to travel from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>. Since doing an
      infinite number of things is not humanly possible, you will
      never be able to reach <m>b</m>. Finally, since this holds for
      any two points <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, movement is impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously, Zeno's paradox doesn't hold, since we are able to
      move from one place to another. But Zeno's paradox has
      commanded the attention and imagination of philosophers and
      mathematicians for over 2000 years, as they struggled to deal
      with the infinity implicit in even the smallest movement.
      Infinite series is one way (though, some would argue, an
      incomplete way) of dealing with Zeno's paradox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we jump into series themselves, we need to start with
      infinite sequences.

          There is another definition of sequences which is quite
          useful. Instead of thinking of <m>\NN</m> as an index, we
          can think of a sequence <m>\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> as a
          function:
          <me>
            f: \NN \rightarrow \RR \hspace{2cm} f(n) = a_n
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If we think of sequences as functions on <m>\NN</m>, then we can
      use all of the language of functions. In this way, sequences
      can be increasing, decreasing, monotonic, bounded above, bounded
      below and bounded. However, since the domain <m>\NN</m> is
      seperated into discrete numbers, this function <m>f</m> has no
      continuity properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though we stated the definition for indices in <m>\NN</m>,
      we can choose another starting point:
      <m>\{a_n\}_{n=3}^\infty</m> is a sequence which starts with
      <m>a_3</m>, and <m>\{a_n\}_{n=-2}^\infty</m> is a sequences
      which starst with <m>a_{-2}</m>. We still always count up from
      the starting point.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many, many sequences studied in mathematics. The
      Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) is a repository
      for interesting sequences with integer values. As of August 20,
      2018, there were 313927 sequences in the OEIS.

    <title>Limits of Sequences</title>
    <p>
      As functions <m>\NN \rightarrow \RR</m>, sequences are not
      continuous, so we can't ask for limits at finite values.
      However, since the index <m>n \rightarrow \infty</m>, we can ask
      for the long term behaviour of the sequence.

            \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_n = L
          </me>
          means that as <m>n</m> gets larger and larger without bound,
          <m>a_n</m> gets closer and closer to <m>n</m>. Similarly,
          the statement
          <me>
            \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_n = \infty
          </me>
          means that as <m>n</m> gets larger and larger without bound
          <m>a_n</m> also gets larger and larger without bound.
          Sequences with finite limits are <term>convergent</term>
          sequences, and all others (where the limit is either
          infinite or non-existant) are <term>divergent</term>

            \forall \epsilon > 0 \ \ \exists N \in \NN \text{ such

          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We say that the sequence has an infinite limit if

      To understand limits, we can make great use of the perspective

          Let <m>a_n = \frac{f_n+1}{f_n}</m>. We can look at the

          <m>f_{n+1} = f_{n} + f_{n-1}</m>. We divide this equation
          by <m>f_n</m> and manipulate to identify terms of the

          <me>
            \frac{f_{n+1}}{f_n} = \frac{f_n}{f_n} +
