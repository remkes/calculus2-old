    <p>
      By itself, the technique of partial fractions isn't strictly a technique of integration.
      Rather, it's an algebraic technique for rational functions
      (fractions involving polynomials).
      We we be using it to do integrals of rational functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of important rational functions integrals which we already know (or we can simply look up on the tables):
      <md>
        <mrow>\int \frac{1}{x^r} dx \amp  = \frac{-1}{(r-1)}{x^r-1} \hspace{1cm} r \neq 1</mrow>
        <mrow>\int \frac{1}{x} dx \amp  = \ln |x| + c</mrow>
        <mrow>\int \frac{1}{x+a} dx \amp  = \ln |x+a| + c</mrow>
        <mrow>\int \frac{1}{1+x^2} dx \amp  = \arctan x + c = -\arccot x + c</mrow>
        <mrow>\int \frac{1}{1-x^2} dx \amp  = \arctanh x + c \text{ or }  \arccoth x + c</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      By substitution and manipulation,
      we can use the integrals in the previous list to solve any integrals of this type:
      <me>
        \int \frac{1}{ax+b} dx \hspace{2cm} \int \frac{1}{ax^2 + bx + c} dx \hspace{2cm} \int \frac{2ax+ b}{ax^2+bc+x} dx
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will be using partial fractions to reduce more complicated rational functions to functions of these three types.

    <title>Proper Fractions and Long Division</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>proper</term> rational functions is one where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denmoninator.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      For general rational functions,
      we can reduce to a proper fractions by doing polynomial long division.
      This long division works exactly like long division worked for numbers.
      The only difference is that where long division for numbers looked at place values,
      we look at degrees.
      An example shows the technique.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          \polylongdiv{x^4+3x^2+2x+4}{x^2+4}
        </p>
        <p>
          We see that <m>x^4+3x^2+2x+4</m> divided by <m>x^2+4</m> is <m>x^2-1</m> remainder <m>2x+8</m>,
          so we write
          <me>
            \frac{x^4+3x^2+2x+4}{x^2+4} = x^2 - 1 + \frac{2x+8}{x^2+4}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, if we were to integrate, we would have
          <me>
            \int \frac{x^4+3x^2+2x+4}{x^2+4} dx = \int \left( x^2 - 1 + \frac{2x+8}{x^2+4} \right) dx = \frac{x^3}{3} - x + \int \frac{2x+8}{x^2+4} dx
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we have polynomial long division,we only have to solve integration problems for proper rational functions.
        </p>

      If we add or subtract polynomial,
      we use common denominator.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \frac{1}{x-3} + \frac{1}{x+4} = \frac{(x+4) +
          (x-3)}{(x-3)(x+4)} = \frac{2x+1}{x^2+x-12}
        </me>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The process is similar for more complicatied polynomials:
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{x^2-2}{x^3-3x} + \frac{1}{x^2-4x+3} \amp  = \frac{x^2-2}{x^2(x-3)} + \frac{1}{(x-3)(x-1)}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \frac{(x-1)(x^2-2}{x^2(x-3)(x-1)} + \frac{x^2}{x^2(x-3)(x-1)} = \frac{(x-1)(x^2-2) + x^2}{x^2(x-3)(x-1)}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \frac{x^3-2x+2}{x^2(x-3)(x-1)} = = \frac{x^3-2x+2}{x^4 - 4x^3+ 3x^2}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Partial fractions asks the opposite question:
      if we are given a complicated rational function,
      how can we <em>undo</em> common denominator and express the function as a sum of simplier fractions.
      Partial fractions is nothing more
      (or less)
      than common denominator done backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first step of undoing common denominator is factoring polynomials.
      We see that the common demoninator in the previous example is <m>x^4 - 4x^3 + 3x^2</m>,
      but the seperate fractions have denominators which are <em>factors</em>
      of the common denomintor.
      In order to undo common denominator,
      we need to factor the denomintor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Factoring polynomials is, in general, a very difficult task.
      Over <m>\RR</m>, there are two types of factors:
      linear and quadratic. (It is a nice theorem that all polynomials factor completely into such factors;
      we are not going to investigate that theorem in this course).
      Linear factors have the form <m>(x-\alpha)</m>.
      A polynomial has a linear factor
      <m>(x-\alpha)</m> if and only if <m>\alpha</m> is a root of the polynomial,
      so finding linear factors is equivalently difficult to finding roots.
      This can be done for low degree polynomials,
      but for degree five and above,
      there is no exact process.
      Even for low degrees, finding roots is hardly trivial.
      An quadratic factor has the form
      <m>(x^2 + \alpha x + \beta)</m> and is called irreducible if it has no real roots
      (so doesn't factor further into two linear factors).
      Though the general problem is quite difficult,
      we'll be working with polynomials which factor reasonably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now say that <m>\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}</m> is a proper rational function and
      <m>q(x) = q_1(x) q_2(x) \ldots q_r(x)</m> is a factorization into linear and irreducible quadratic factors.
      Then we want to find new numerators <m>p_i</m> to undo the common denominator,
      as in the following expression.
      <me>
        \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = \frac{p_1(x)}{q_1(x)} + \frac{p_2(x)}{q_2(x)} + \frac{p_3(x)}{q_3(x)} + \ldots + \frac{p_r(x)}{q_r(x)}
      </me>
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If we can find these numerators,
          this decomposition is called a <term>partial fraction decomposision</term>,
          of often just <sq>partial fractions.</sq>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Partial fractions is a long and difficult process.
      It's best to try to understand it through examples.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \frac{x+2}{x^2- 5x - 6}
        </me>
        <p>
          The denominator factors as <m>(x-6)(x+1)</m>,
          so we look for a partial fraction decomposition of the following form.
          <me>
            \frac{x+2}{x^2- 5x - 6} = \frac{a}{x-6} + \frac{b}{x+1}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We take the right side to common denominator.
          <me>
            \frac{x+2}{x^2- 5x - 6} = \frac{a}{x-6} + \frac{b}{x+1} = \frac{a(x+1) + b(x-6)}{(x-6)(x+1)} = \frac{(a+b)x + (a-6b)}{x^2 - 5x -6}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since both polymomials are the same,
          the numerators must be the same.
          <me>
            x+2 = (a+b)x + (a-6b)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Polynomials are equal only if their coefficient are equal,
          so this gives us two equations:
          <md>
            <mrow>1 \amp  = a+b</mrow>
            <mrow>2 \amp  = a-6b</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          We have to solve these two equations for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
          We do this by isolating and replacing.
          The first equation gives <m>a = 1-b</m>,
          which we substitute in the second equation to get
          <m>2 = (1-b) -6b</m> which is <m>1 = -7b</m> or <m>b = \frac{-1}{7}</m>.
          The we substitute back to get <m>a = 1-b = 1 - \frac{-1}{7} = \frac{8}{7}</m>.
          These are our numerators.
          <me>
            \frac{x+2}{x^2- 5x - 6} = \frac{\frac{8}{7}}{x-6} + \frac{\frac{-1}{7}}{x-1}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, this helps us integrate by splitting the original integral up into easier pieces.
          <md>
            <mrow>\int \frac{x+2}{x^2- 5x - 6} dx \amp  = \int \frac{\frac{8}{7}}{x-6} dx + \int \frac{\frac{-1}{7}}{x-1} dx</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \frac{8}{7} \int \frac{1}{x-6} dx - \frac{1}{7} \int \frac{1}{x-1} dx</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \frac{8}{7} \ln |x-6| - \frac{1}{7} \ln |x-1| + C</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \int \frac{x^2+1}{x^3+4x^2+x+6} dx
        </me>
        <p>
          The denominator has <m>x=-1</m> as a root by inspection.
          (Our best methods for roots of cubics,
          for now, is guessing and testing.)
          The denominator factors as <m>(x+1)(x^2-5x+6) = (x+1)(x-2)(x-3)</m>.
          There are three (non-repeated) linear factors.
          Therefore, we look for a partial fractions decomposition of the following form.
          <me>
            \frac{x^2+1}{x^3+4x^2+x+6} = \frac{a}{x+1} + \frac{b}{x-2} + \frac{c}{x-3}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The new fractions must be proper,
          so they only have constant numerators.
          Our task is to try to find these unknowns <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>c</m>.
          This is our general process:
          we will write the expected expanded form,
          write the numerators as unknowns and use common denominator try to find the unknown coefficients.
          Let's proceed with this example.
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{x^2+1}{x^3+4x^2+x+6} \amp  = \frac{a}{x+1} + \frac{b}{x-2} + \frac{c}{x-3}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \frac{a(x-2)(x-3) + b(x+1)(x-3) + c(x+1)(x-2)} {(x+1)(x-2)(x-3)}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \frac{ax^2 -5ax + 6a + bx^2 - 2bx - 3b + cx^2 - cx - 2x} {(x+1)(x-2)(x-3)}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \frac{(a+b+c)x^2 + (-5a-2b-c)x + (6a-3b-2c)} {(x+1)(x-2)(x-3)} \</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we have equality and the denominators are the same,
          the numerators must also be the same.
          <me>
            x^2 + 1 = x^2 + 0x + 1= (a+b+c)x^2 + (-5a-2b-c)x + (6a-3b-2c)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Two polynomials are only equal if all their coefficients are equal,
          so we can change this into a system of three equations. (We will always get a linear system here,
          which is convenient for those who know linear algebra).
          <md>
            <mrow>a+b+c \amp  = 1</mrow>
            <mrow>-5a-2b-c \amp  = 0</mrow>

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a system of linear equations.
          There are many ways to solve such system,
          but for now we can isolate and replace.

            <mrow>\amp  \text{ Then substitute back }</mrow>
            <mrow>b \amp  = \frac{5 - 4 \frac{10}{3}}{3} = \frac{15-40}{9} = \frac{-25}{9}</mrow>
            <mrow>a = 1 - b - c \amp  = 1 + \frac{25}{9} - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{9+25-30}{9} = \frac{14}{9}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The values <m>a = \frac{14}{9}</m>,
          <m>b = \frac{-25}{9}</m> and
          <m>c = \frac{10}{3}</m> are the appropriate denominators,
          we conclude that
          <me>
            \frac{x^2+1}{x^3-4x^2+x+6} = \frac{\frac{14}{9}}{x+1} - \frac{\frac{25}{9}}{x-2} + \frac{\frac{10}{3}}{x-3}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, this helps us with integration,
          since the integral of the original rational function is now a sum of three easier integrals.
