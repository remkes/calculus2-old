  <title>Manipulation of Series</title>
  <p>
    Once we have defined convergent series, we want to be able to work
    with them algebraically.  There are several important
    manipulations and techniques.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, series are linear as long as the indices match up.  This
    means we can bring out constants and split series over sums.

      <mrow>
        c \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n \amp  = \sum_{n=0}^\infty ca_n
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty (a_n \pm b_n) \amp  = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n
        \pm \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n
      </mrow>
    </md>
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, we can remove terms.  Since a series is just notation for
    a sum, we can take out leading terms and write them in
    conventional notation.
    <me>
      \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \sum_{n=3}^\infty a_n
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Third, we can shift the indices.  The key idea here is balance:
    whatever we do to the index in the bounds, we do the opposite to
    the index in the terms to balance it out.
    <me>
      \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{n-1} =
      \sum_{n=-1}^\infty a_{n+1}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Both techniques are very useful, particularly for combining
    series.

      <p>
        In this example, we want to add two series which don't have
        matching indices.  We shift the first series to make the
        indices match and allow the addition.

            \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{3^n}{n!} + \sum_{n=0}^\infty
            \frac{1}{n(n+2)} \amp  = \sum_{n=0}^\infty
            \frac{3^{n+2}}{(n+2)!} + \sum_{n=0}^\infty
            \frac{1}{n(n+2)} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(
            \frac{3^{n+2}}{(n+2)!} + \frac{1}{n(n+2} \right)
          </mrow>
          <mrow>
            \amp  = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left( \frac{3^{n+2} +
            (n-1)!(n+1)}{(n+2)!} \right)
