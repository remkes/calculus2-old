    <title>Asymptotes and Infinite Domains</title>
    <p>
      It is sometimes useful to consider definite integrals where the
      function has an asymptote at one (or both!) of the bounds of
      integration. A function which is undefined in the middle of the
      interval cannot be integrated, but a function which has an
      asymptote at the edge might still have a reasonable area under
      its curve. Similarly, it is also useful to consider integration
      over infinite intervals, such as the entire real number line or
      <m>[0, \infty)</m>.  Both of these goals present problems for
      the integral as defined so far. To solve them, I need an
      additional technique. First, though, let me define a term to
      refer to these integrals.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          These two types of integral (where there is a vertical
          asymptote at one of the endpoint, or where the interval of
          integration is infinite) are called <term>improper
          integrals</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p> 
      The approach to improper integrals is quite direct. If there is
      an asymptote at one edge of the domain of integration, say at
      <m>c_0</m>, I set the bounds of integation to be a variable
      <m>a</m> and take the limit <m>a \rightarrow c_0</m>. Similarly,
      if the domain extends to infinity, as in <m>[0,\infty)</m>, I
      integrate over <m>[0, a]</m> and take the limit as <m>a
      \rightarrow \infty</m>. In either case, a limit of the bounds of
      integration solves the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since there is a limit involved, an improper integral may or may
      not converge. The area under the curve might be infinite, or just
      undefined if the limit does not exist. The usual question for an
      improper integral is the convergence question: is the described
      area finite or infinite? 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If there is a finite area, if the limit exists, the improper
          integral <term>converges</term>. Otherwise, the improper
          integral <term>diverges</term>. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      There will be some interesting discussion of the implications of
      divergence and convergence this in <xref
      ref="section-probability" />.  For now, let me move on to some
      examples.

          Let me try to calculate the area under the curve of
          <m>\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}</m> on the interval <m>[0,2]</m>. There
          is an asymptote at the left endpoint, so this is an improper
          integral. The function is positive, so there is a well-defined
          positive area under the curve. The question is whether this
          area is finite or infinite as the function grows along the
          asymptote. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I calculate the integral by taking a limit approaching the
          left endpoint. Note that I need a one-sided limit here: I can
          only approach <m>0</m> from the positive side. 
        </p>

          \int_a^2 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} dx 
         </me>
        <p>
          Then I can just calculate the integral with the bound <m>a</m>
          and take the limit.

          - 0 = 2\sqrt{2}
        </me>
        <p>
          I get a nice, finite answer. The area in <xref
          ref="figure-improper-integral1" />, even though the asymptote
          grows to infinity, is finite.

          Here is an example with an integral over an infinte domain.
          There is no veritcal asymptote, but the area extends out along
          the <m>x</m> axis to infinity, as show in <xref
          ref="figure-improper-integral2" />.

        <p>
          It's not at all obvious how much area there is under the
          integral as the bounds go off to infinity. The limit will
          indicate whether this in infinite or finite area. I set the
          upper bound to <m>a</m> and take the limit as <m>a \rightarrow
          \infty</m>.

        <me>
          \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2} dx = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty}
          \int_1^a \frac{1}{x^2} dx = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty}
          \frac{-1}{x} \Bigg|_1^a = \lim_{a \rightarrow
          \infty} \frac{-1}{a} + 1 = 1
        </me>
        <p>
          In this way, I show that the unknown area under the curve of
          <m>\frac{1}{x^2}</m> is indeed finite, even when the bound
          goes to infinity.

        <p>
          This is very similar to the previous example, but the
          antiderivative of <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> differs from that of
          <m>\frac{1}{x^2}</m> in an important way. I use a limit to
          evaluate the integral on the infinite interval.

          \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x} dx = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty}

          \ln |x| \Bigg|_1^a = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \ln a - 0
          = \infty
        </me>
        <p>
          The shape of the graphs of <m>\frac{1}{x^2}</m> and
          <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> on the interval <m>[1,\infty)</m> are very
          similar: they both start at <m>(1,1)</m> and decay to zero.
          However, <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> decays slower. This difference in
          decay rate is enough that the area under <m>\frac{1}{x^2}</m>
          is finite and the area under <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> is infinite,
          which is somewhat surprising if you just look at the graph.
          These two graphs are shown in <xref
          ref="figure-improper-integral3" />. In the graph, it is clear
          to see that <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> has greater area, but it is
          hard to see from the image that the difference is enough to
          actually produce infinite area.

          I want to look more carefully at the previous two examples. Both
          had integrands of the form <m>\frac{1}{x^p}</m> for some
          exponent <m>p</m>. I showed that <m>p=1</m> gives a divergent
          integral and <m>p=2</m> gives a convergent integral. If <m>p
          \lt 1</m> then <m>\frac{1}{x^p} > \frac{1}{x}</m>. If one
          positive function is larger than another, then the area under
          its graph must be larger. Since the area under
          <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> between <m>1</m> and <m>\infty</m> is
          already <m>\infty</m>, the integral of <m>\frac{1}{x^p}</m> on

    <title>Improper Integrals and Comparisons</title>
    <p>
      I've already implicitly used a comparison argument in <xref
      ref="example-improper1" />. I said that
      <m>\frac{1}{x^p} > \frac{1}{x}</m> for <m>p \lt 1</m> and used that
      fact to argue convergence. This kind of comparsion is a general
      property of integrals: if <m>f(x) \geq g(x)</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>,
      then
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_a^b f(x) dx \geq \int_a^b g(x)
    </me>
    <p>
      The same inequality holds for improper integrals, at least
      adopting the convention that that <m>\infty > a</m> for any
      finite number <m>a</m>. (While this comparison is reasonable,
      infinity is still not a number and I will not do arithmetic with
      it). This type of comparison is useful for evaluating improper
      integrals. However, a more useful comparison makes use of
      asymptotic analysis. The following theorem is presented here
      wihtout proof.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider an improper integral with integrand <m>f(x)</m>.
          The asymptotic order of <m>f(x)</m> determines the
          convergence of an improper integral. That is, if <m>f(x)</m>
          is replaced with any other function with the same asymptotic
          order, then the integral will have the same convergence
          behaviour. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      What does this mean? If means that if you only care about
      convergence/divergence (and not the exact value of the integral),
      then you only need to consider the asymptotic order of the
      integrand. This means you can deal with much easier integrals to
      determine convergence. Let me do an example which illustrates
      this.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{4 + x + 18x^2}
        </me>
        <p>
          The asymptotic order of the denominator is <m>x^2</m>.
          Therefore, the convengence behaviour is the same as if the
          integrand were <m>\frac{1}{x^2}</m>. This is <m>p=2</m>,
          which is <m>p \gt 1</m>, so the integral converges. This use of
          asymptotic order allows me to dramatically simply the
          situation: I don't have to evaluate the complicated quadratic
          integral to determine convergence or divergence. (I would, of
          course, have to evaluate the complicated quadratic integral if
          I wanted to determine the exact value of the improper
          integral).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The previous example is an example of a relatively common
      occurance. Often, the important fact is convergence. If there is
      an improper integral that I want to work with, that I want to
      measure something, I need to make sure it converges. I might not
      need to know its value (at least not right away); I might just
      want to do some other proofs or calculations with it. Therefore,
      often using asymptotical analysis to quickly test convergence
      allows progress in some calculations, even though the value of
      the integral hasn't be exactly determined.
