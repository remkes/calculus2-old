    <title>Slopes</title>
    <p>
      In the study of algebraic plane curves in <xref
      ref="section-algebraic-plane-curves" />, implicit derivatives
      were used to calculate the slope of loci and classify
      singularities where the slope was undefined. The calculus of
      loci was restricted to properties of the shape, such a slopes
      and singularities. In contrast, there is a rich calculus for
      parametric curves which calculates slopes as well as local
      directions of movement, speed of movement along the curve, and
      total distance travelled. Since there is a time variable, time
      derivatives will measure the movement of a point along the
      curve. 
    </p>
    <p>
      First, as with loci, I want to calculate <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>:
      the slope of the curve. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))</m> is a parametric curve, then
          the slope of the parametric curve is given by the expression 
        </p>
        <me>
          \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}}
        </me>
        <p>
          If either of the derivatives are undefined, or if
          <m>x^\prime(t) = 0</m> at some value of <m>t</m>, the slope
          is undefined. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The situation for undefined slopes is similar but not exactly
      the same as singularities for algebraic plane curve. When
      <m>x^\prime(t)</m> approaches <m>0</m> but <m>y^\prime(t)
      </m> does not, the slope will approach infinity. In the
      limit, I can conclude that there will be a vertical tangent.
      This is very much the same as for loci, where an infinite
      limit in the implicit derivaitve indicates a vertical tangent.
      However, self-intersection of a parametric curve is no longer
      a problem, since the intersection will occur for different
      values of <m>t</m>. Each path through the self intersection
      will have its own slope. Finally, when the derivatives are not
      defined, the curve may have a sharp corner like the cusps for
      algebraic plane curves.

          The domain for this curve comes in two disconnected parts,
          so I could think of this as two individual curves. When <m>t
          \in (-\infty, -1)</m>, I get the part of the curve below the
          <m>x</m> axis, and when <m>t \in (-1, \infty)</m>, I get the
          part of the curve above the <m>x</m> axis. Though it looks
          like the two parts connect in <xref ref="figure-folium" />,
          the lower part of the curve only approaches <m>(0,0)</m>
          from below but never actually reaches it.

        <p>
          The folium is historically interesting because it was (as
          the name suggests) studied by Descartes. He was concerned,
          specifically, with the slope of the folium; this was a
          question he couldn't answer with the mathematics of his day.
          This question was answered by Newton in the following
          decades, using the techniques of calculus. Let me follow in
          these steps and calculate the slope of the folium.

    <title>Velocity and Distance on a Parametric Curve</title>
    <p>
      Slopes are common to both parametric curves and loci. Movement,
      however, is unique to parametric curve. I know what to describe
      the calculus of this movement, starting with velocity and
      distance.  The variable <m>s</m> is conventionally used to
      represent distance along a curve. Velocity is the rate of change
      of distance, so it should be <m>\frac{ds}{dt}</m>. The following
      argument tries to construct a way to calculate this velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The functions <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m> represent movement of
      the two coordinates of the points on a curve. If there is a
      change in coordinates <m>\Delta x</m> and <m>\Delta y</m>, then
      the change in total distance is given by the pythagoreaon
      theorem: <m>\Delta s = \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2}</m>. If
      these change in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> happen over some fixed
      interval <m>\Delta t</m>, then I can divide the pythagorean
      combination by this <m>\Delta t</m>. On the right side, I can
      bring the <m>\Delta t</m> into the square root. 
    </p>
    <me>
      \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta
      t} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} \right)^2} 
    </me>
    <p>
      Then I can take the limit of this expression as <m>\Delta t
      \rightarrow 0</m>. Under the square root, the limit will produce
      the derivative of the two coordinate variables. On the left, it
      will produce the derivative of the new distance variable
      <m>s</m>. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))</m> be a parametric curve.
          The speed of the parametric curve is the derivative
          <m>\frac{ds}{dt}</m> and is calculated as follows. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \frac{ds}{dt} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2 +
          \left( \frac{dy}{dt} \right)^2}
        </me>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If I just differentiated <m>\gamma(t)</m> component-wise, I
      would get <m>\gamma\prime(t) = (x^\prime(t), y^\prime(t))</m>.
      Using this convention, the speed is the length of this
      derivative: <m>\frac{ds}{dt} = |\gamma^\prime(t)|</m>. This is a
      very natural language for describing derivatives of parametric
      curve, but it realies on a bit more vector algebra than I've
      established in this course. In Multivariable Calculus, the
      calculus of parametric curves (particular in three dimensions)
      is extended using this kind of vector algebra. For now, let
      me just calculate some examples of velocity of cuves using the
      expression in the definition above.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The curve <m>\gamma(t) = (t,t)</m> has derivatives
          <m>x^\prime(t) = 1</m> and <m>y^\prime(t) = 1</m>.
          Therefore, <m>\frac{ds}{dt} = \sqrt{1+1} = \sqrt{2}</m>; the
          curve has a constant speeed of <m>\sqrt{2}</m> units of
          distance per unit of time. In each unit of time, the curve
          increases from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(1,1)</m>, then to
          <m>(2,2)</m>, then to <m>(3,3)</m> and so ong. The distance
          between any two consecutive points is <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, so
          the curve does cover <m>\sqrt{2}</m> units of distance per
          unit of time. It makes sense that the speed is constant.

      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The curve <m>\gamma(t) = (t^2,t^2)</m> traces the same line.
          It has derivatives <m>x^\prime(t) = 2t</m> and
          <m>y^\prime(t) = 2t</m>, so the speed is <m>\frac{ds}{dt} =
          \sqrt{4t^2 + 4t^2} = 2\sqrt{2} t</m>. Though it travels the
          same line as the previous example, it accelerates as it
          travels along that line.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The curve <m>\gamma(t) = \left(\frac{1}{t}, \frac{1}{t}
          \right)</m> again traces the same line, though in the
          opposite direction. It's derivatives are <m>x^\prime(t) =
          \frac{-1}{t^2}</m> and <m>y^\prime(t) = \frac{-1}{t^2}</m>.
          The speed is <m>\frac{ds}{dt} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{t^4} +
          \frac{1}{t^4}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{t^2}</m>, which gets slower
          and slower. This makes sense, since it only approaches the
          origin as <m>t \rightarrow \infty</m>. In that approach, it
          gets slower and slower so that it never actually reaches the
          origin.

          Notice that <m>1-\cos t</m> is always non-negative, so

          <m>t=2\pi</m> and any other multiple of <m>2\pi</m>, the

          The cycloid is the path of a point on the edge of a wheel as
          the wheel rolls. When <m>t</m> is a multiple of <m>2\pi</m>,
          the point on the wheel is momentarily in contact with the
          ground and its speed is momentarily zero.  That means that
          on a rolling wheel, the point touching the ground at any
          instant is momentarily stationary. This is something to
          ponder the next time you watch a train or other fast moving
          wheeled vehicle: at every instant in time, there is at least
          one point on each wheel which isn't moving at all.

          An interesting example is calculating the perimeter of an
          ellipse. It's an impotant calculation historically, since it
          can determine the length of elliptical orbits (among other
          applications).  Assume that the ellipse is centred at the
          origin and positioned so its largest semi-axis is along the
          <m>x</m> axis. Let <m>a</m> be the semi-major axis and
          <m>b</m> be the semi-minor. Then <m>\gamma(t) = (a
          \cos t, b \sin t)</m> for <m>t \in [0,2\pi]</m> describes
          the ellipse as a parametric curve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before calculating, it is convenient to also define a new
          quantity: the eccentricity of the ellipse. This is defined
          as <m>e = \frac{\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}{a}</m> (assuming that
          <m>a\geq b</m>) and it always a number in <m>[0,1)</m>.
          Eccentricity is a nice way of measuring how close an ellipse
          is to a circle. If <m>e = 0</m> then <m>a=b</m> and the
          ellipse is exactly 
          a circle. As <m>e \rightarrow 1</m> the ellipse becomes
          less circular and more elongated. With the eccentricity
          defined, I'll try to calculate the arclength of the
          parametric curve <emdash /> the circumference of the
          ellipse. (This <m>e</m> is not to be confused with the
          notation for the exponential function. Sorry to re-use a
          letter that already has an important purpose, but the use of
          <m>e</m> for eccentricity here is conventional and, in this
          integral at least, I can avoid any exponential functions
          that would confuse the issue.)

          If <m>e=0</m>, then the cosine disappears and I have an easy

          difficult. This is so difficult, in fact, that it has a
          special name: this is an elliptic integral of the second
          kind. These integrals have been studied for three hundred
          years, and with good cause, since they have no elementary
          anti-derivatives. Even without an elementary
          anti-derivative, however, the behaviour can be investigated.
          This has led to many insights in geometry; elliptic curves
          (a type of algebraic plane curve) come from the long process
          of trying to understand this integral.

      Before moving on with the discussion of parametric curves, I'm

      substitution rule for integration. (A <sq>lemma</sq> in
      mathematic is a short statement, usually used a part of a larger

    <title>Independence of Parametrization</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="example-pc1" />, I looked at a couple
      different parametrizations of the circle and checked the
      calculation to make sure that both parametrizations produced the
      correct circumference. This is a special case of a much more
      general issue. Parametric curves come with parametrizations and
      different parametrization can describe the same shape. Some
      notions, like speed, should naturally depend on the
      parametrizations. However, other notions like total distance
      should be intrinsic to the <em>shape</em>, not the rate of
      movement along the shape.  With parametric objects, I have to
      distinguish between that which depends on the parameter (like
      speed) and that which is intrinsic to the shape (like
      arclength). For the latter, I have to make sure that if I use a
      parametrization to calculate an intrinsic quantity, the result
      is independent of the parametrization. For now, I'm concerned
      just with arclength.

    <p>
      I have proved that arclength is independent of parametrization.
      There are other properties of the shape of a parametric curve
      (such as curvature) that will be introduced in Multivariable
      Calculus; all of these geometric properties will also be
      independent of paramtrization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though these properties are independent of parametrization,
      there is no way to calculate them without using a
      parametrization. This is a surprisingly common situation in
      mathematics. Many objects are defined in a way that seems to
      involve an arbitrary choice, such as a parametrization. (As I
      said earlier, each shape has infinitely many parametrization.)
      To work with the object, a choice must be made. But
      mathematicians want the properties to be independent of the
      choice, which requires careful and often difficult proofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ideally, there would be a special or privileged choice, to make
      it easier to access the properties of the object. For parametric
      curves, there is such a thing. It will be defined in the next
      section.

    <title>Parametrization by Arclength</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>parametrization by arclength</term> is the
          parametrization in the special variable <m>s</m> where
          <m>\frac{ds}{dt} = 1</m>, i.e., the unique parametrization
          where movement along the curve always has a speed of one
          unit of distance per unit of time. The starting point of the
          curve is at <m>s = 0</m> and the range of <m>s</m> is <m> s
          \in [0, L]</m> where <m>L</m> is the length of the curve.
          The use of the variable <m>s</m> for parametrization by
          arclength is conventional; I will only use <m>s</m> as a
          parameter when I want to indicate the parametrization by
          arclength (as oppsed to the use of <m>t</m> and <m>u</m> as
          paramaters in various calculations so far).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The parameter <m>s</m> is simply the distance travelled along
      the curve. If the movement always moves one unit of distance per
      unit of time, then after <m>s</m> units of time, the movement
      has covered <m>s</m> units of distance, for all choices of the
      parameter <m>s</m>. Therefore, it is approprate to treat the
      parameter <m>s</m> as the distance covered. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that it's defined, I would like an algorithm to construct
      the parametrization by arclength.  In order to do this, I need a
      new function: the arclength function. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\gamma(t)</m> be a parametric curve for <m>t \in
          [a,b]</m>.  The the function defined by the following
          integral is called the <term>arclength function</term> of
          the parametric curve.

        <me>
          s(t) = \int_a^t \sqrt{(x^\prime(u))^2 + (y^\prime(u))^2} du
        </me>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The domain of <m>s(t)</m> is <m>t \in [a,b]</m>, the parameter
      domain for the curve. The range of <m>s</m> is <m>[0,L]</m>,
      since when <m>t=a</m>, the integral has no interval to integrate
      over, and when <m>t = b</m>, the integral just gives the entire
      length of the curve.  Since the parameter variable <m>t</m> is
      outside the integral, I needed to defined the temporary variable
      <m>u</m> to do the integration. (The same variable should never
      show up as a variable of integration and a variable existing
      outside the intergral.) The arclength function measures how much
      distance the curve has covered as the parameter goes from the start
      <m>a</m> to <m>t</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arclength function is guaranteed to be an increasing
      function, since it is an integral of a positive function.
      Therefore it is invertible. 
      Typically, the inverse is written 
      <m>t(s)</m> where <m>s \in [0, L]</m>. Then I can
      substitute <m>t(s)</m> for <m>t</m> to get <m>\gamma(t(s))</m>,
      a reparametrization.
    </p>
    <p>
      What has this reparametrization accomplished?  I've turned the
      arclength function into the parameter. Therefore, this is the
      parametrization by arclength. It is the unique parametrization
      with speed one, where the parameter and length along the curve
      are always the same. Let me summarize the algorithm.
