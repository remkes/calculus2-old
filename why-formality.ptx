  <title>Why Formality?</title>
  <p>
    We open with an important theme: the formalization of mathematics.
    Historically, the calculus developed in a form which would seem
    very strange to us now. The notations and styles of argument
    used by Newton and Leibniz are almost unreadable to modern eyes.
    What we teach as the calculus is the product of three hundred
    years of careful improvement and formalization: Newton and
    Leibniz's insights and breakthroughs have been translated into
    formal notations and modern mathematics. This historical process
    was far from easy: there were many competing schools of thought
    and styles that influenced notation and presentation,
    and some of the arguments between the various schools continue to
    the present day in academic mathematics. But, in general, the
    process is best understood as increasing formalization, where
    loose, intuitive ideas slowly morphed into logical, rigorous
    constructions.

    That said, what we present in first-year, first-term calculus is
    hardly the pinnacle of formality. In a pedagogical setting, we
    make decisions about how much to rely on intuition and how much to
    give proper, full, formal definitions. A good example of choosing
    formality is the use of the Riemann Integral in Calculus I. Even
    though we didn't work with it extensively, the Riemann integral
    was presented to show a formal, logical definition. We could have
    just included the intuitive idea of the limits of an approximation
    processes; instead, we choose to show, in full detail, how this
    limit was accomplished. Hopefully, the Riemann Integral gave a
    fuller sense of the mathematical construction, though it risked
    alienating students who struggle with the abstract categorigies
    involved. Everywhere in mathematical pedagogy, decisions about
    levels of formality are required.

    In the start of this course, we'll be working through the idea of
    mathematical formalization by talking about the construction of
    the real numbers and limits.
