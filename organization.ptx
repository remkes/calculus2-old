  <title>Organization of the Course</title>
  <p>
    This course is run with a flipped classroom teaching model.
    The majority of the content is delivered outside of class time through two avenues:
    these notes and a series of short videos.
    You will be required to watch a short videos before most lecture periods.
    We will begin each lecture period assuming you have watched the videos.
  </p>
  <p>
    The videos are used to introduce the main topics of the course;
    they are the explanation.
    Along with each video and lecture period,
    there will be a short section of notes.
    The notes are provided for reference,
    so that after you've watched the video,
    you can use the notes to remind yourself of the content and refer to useful ideas,
    concepts and formlas.
    The notes are not written to stand alone;
    instead, they are written to provide a record of the ideas in the video for your reference.
    The notes are light on examples.
    The lecture time will be mostly devoted to necessary practice and examples.>
  </p>
  <p>
    The course is organized into 27 lectures;
    the videos and the activities are numbered to match these lectures.
    There is a detailed schedule on the course website showing when the various lectures happen over the term.
    Please use this schedule to ensure you watch the appropriate videos before class and bring the appropriate sections of the notes.
