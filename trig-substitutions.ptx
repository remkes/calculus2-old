  <title>Trigonometric Substitutions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The last major technique for integration is the technique of
      trigonometric substitutions. While these are  just a
      new type of substitution, they are a very counter-intuitive
      class of substitutions which deserve their own section. Other
      subsittution were set up by looking for compositions (inside
      function where the derivative of the inside was also present),
      or sometimes trying to simplify denominator. Here, the
      substitution strategy is entirely new.
    </p>
    <p>
      The integral in this section will rely heavily on the techniques
      of <xref ref="section-trig-integrals" />: the general technique
      will be to reduce a certain class of integrals to a
      trigonometric integral and then proceed to use the previous
      developed techniques for trig integrals. Like many integration
      techniques, the current technique doesn't really solve integrals
      directly <emdash /> instead, it reduces them to a previously
      understood type of integral.

    <title>A Review of Pythagorus</title>
    <p>
      The famous pythagorean theorem says gives the relationship
      between the side lengths of a right triangle: <m>a^2 + b^2 =
      c^2</m>, where <m>c</m> is the length of the longest side, the
      hypotenuse. The importance of this theorem comes from its
      ubiquity in solving geometric problem. Many geometric problems
      can be restated in terms of right triangles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, as I've argued in previous calculus material, the
      pythagorean theorem can be reinterpreted as a theorm about
      circles. A point a circle of radius <m>c</m> has <m>x</m>
      coordinate <m>a = c \cos \theta</m> and <m>y</m> coordinate <m>b
      = c \sin \theta</m>. The radius of length <m>c</m> forms the
      hypotenuse of a right triangle, with the other two sides being
      the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates. The pythagoreaon theorem
      is equivalent to the fundamental trig identity: <m>c^2 \cos^2
      \theta + c^2 \sin^2 \theta = c^2</m> or, if I cancel the
      <m>c^2</m>, <m>\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1</m>. Thus, the
      pythagorean theorem can be seen as a way of making calculations
      for circle geometry as much as for triangle geometry. The circle
      is a fundamental shape in many geometric problems, again
      illustrating the importance of the pythagorean theorem.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've just reviewed and argued that the pythagorean theorem is
      ubiquitous in solving all kinds of very concrete geometric
      problems. Let me be more explicit about the kinds of mathematics
      that come from this ubiquity. If I know two sides of a right
      triangle and need to find the third, I rearrange the pythagorean
      theorem to find the missing quantity. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>
        If I need to find <m>a</m>, I solve to get <m>a = \sqrt{c^2 -
        b^2}</m>. 
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        If I need to find <m>b</m>, I solve to get <m>b = \sqrt{c^2 -
        a^2}</m>. 
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        If I need to find <m>c</m>, I solve to get <m>c = \sqrt{a^2 +
        b^2}</m>. 
      </p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So, solving with pythagorus leads to expressions where I have a
      square root with a sum or difference of squares inside it. Now let
      me consider a situation where I have functions involving 
      the pythagorean theorem. If I let one of the three sides of the
      triangle be the independent variable, I can get three different
      expressions: <m>\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}</m>, <m>\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}</m>
      and <m>\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}</m>. Functions that come from the use of
      the pythagorean theorem in geometry invariable have one of these
      three forms.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-trig-substitution">
    <title>Trigonometric Substitution</title>
    <p>
      From the previous section, I argued that functions involving the
      three terms <m>\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}</m>, <m>\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}</m> and
      <m>\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}</m> are important and common. We often also
      have to do integrals with these kinds of functions. The technique
      I use to solve integrals that involve one of these three forms
      is trigonometric substitution. I am going to replace the
      variable <m>x</m> with a suitable trigonometric function.
    </p>
    <p>
      So why trigonometry? The idea is to use the square identities
      (<m>\cos^2 x + \sin^2 x = 1</m>, <m>1 + \tan^2 x = \sec^2 x</m> and
      <m>\cot^2 x + 1 = \csc^2 x</m>) to get rid of the square root.
      The square roots are the real barrier to these integrals; other
      than a couple very specific forms that have a simple
      antiderivatives, I don't know how to integrate these square
      roots. The trig substitution, along with the use of these square
      identities, is going to get rid of the square root. In doing so,
      it will change the integral into a trig integral, so that the
      techniques of <xref ref="section-trig-integrals" /> can
      hopefully be applied.  I'll work through the three types in turn.

        <p>
          For an integral involving this expression, the appropriate
          substitution is <m>x = a \sin \theta</m>, with differential
          <m>dx = a \cos \theta d \theta</m>. This substitution
          removes the square root when I replace <m>1 - \sin^2
          \theta</m> with <m>\cos^2 \theta</m> using the square
          identity <m>\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta + 1</m>.

          removes the square root when I replace <m>\tan^2

    <title>Examples with Trig Substitutions</title>
    <p>
      I'll present four examples to try to illustrate the method. In
      each example, I look for the appropriate trig substitution.
      Sometimes I might need to do some algebra to get the square root
      into one of the three forms introduced above.  
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \int \sqrt{1-4x^2} dx 
        </me>
        <p>
          This example is close to <m>\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}</m>, but there
          is a coefficient in from of the <m>x</m>. I need to remove
          this to use the trig substitution. I do this by writing
          <m>1</m> as <m>\frac{4}{4}</m> and factoring the <m>4</m>
          out of the square root. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \int \sqrt{1-4x^2} dx = \int \sqrt{\frac{4}{4} - 4x^2} dx =
          \int \sqrt{4 \left( \frac{1}{4} - x^2 \right)} dx 
          = \int 2 \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} - x^2} dx
        </me>
        <p>
          Then I can apply the trig substitution <m>x = a \sin
          \theta</m> with <m>a = \frac{1}{2}</m>.

        <p>
          Putting these pieces in gives me a new integral. Notice that
          with trig substitution, replacing the <m>dx</m> term is
          always easy. I don't need to any extra algebra to construct
          the right term; the <m>dx</m> is always replace by an
          expression in <m>\theta</m> according to the table above.
          After doing the the substitution, I get a trig integral with
          <m>\cos^2 \theta</m>. I use a half-angle identity to do this
          trig integral, splitting into two reasonable integrals by
          linearity.

          Here is an example with bounds. This particular example is
          quite useful: it calculates the area of the ellipse
          <m>\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1</m>. It does this
          by restricting to the quarter of the ellipse in the first
          quadrant, where the area is the area under the curve <m>y =
          \frac{b}{a} \sqrt{a^2-x^2}</m> for <m>x \in [0,a]</m>, and
          then multiplying by <m>4</m> to get the area of the whole
          ellipse.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a sine substitution. Since this is a definite
          integral, I also have to deal with the bounds.  Working with
          the bounds is a little tricky: to get the new bounds in
          <m>\theta</m>, I have to invert the sine function (in this
          case, simply by refering to a unit circle diagram).

          Now I have all the pieces, so I can do the substitution.
          Again, the substitution results in a squared trig function
          which I solve with a half-angle identity. Since this is a
          definite integral, I don't need to reverse the substitution.
          I can just finish the substitution with the new bounds.

          This is a long and complicated example. First, I need to do

          substitution. I write <m>1 = \frac{9}{9}</m> and factor a

          Now I can use a secant substitution. I need to change the

          By taking reciprocals, I can instead invert the cosine
          function, which is more familiar. (I can use the unit circle
          or special triangles to find these inverse values of
