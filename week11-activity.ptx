          The alternating series test says that an alternating series
          converges if and only if the limit of the terms is zero. I

          This is an asymptotic analysis limit and the order is the
          same in both numerator and denominator. The limit is the
          ratio of the leading terms. Since the limit is not zero, the
          series diverges by the alternating series test.

        <p>
          This is a limit of constant zeros, so it is certainly zero,
          and the series converges. (Adds up to 0, in fact, since it
          is just a sum of zeros!)

        <p>
          All three of these are geometric series. The common ratios
          are <m>\frac{1}{7}</m>. <m>\frac{2}{7}</m>, and
          <m>\frac{4}{7}</m>. All the common ratios are less than one,
          so all three series converge, and I conclude that the
          original series also converges.

        <p>
          The asymptotic order of the numerator is <m>\sqrt{n^6} =
          n^3</m>. The asymptotic order of the denominator is
          <m>\sqrt[3]{n^9} = n^3</m>. The limit here is the ratio of
          the leading coefficients, since the asymptotic order of the
          numerator is the same as the denominator. That ratio is 1.
          The limit of the terms is not zero, so by the test for
          divergence, the series diverges.

          Since the logarithm is a growing function, these terms are
          eventuall larger than <m>\frac{1}{n-3}</m>. Those terms are
          (with a shift) the terms of the divergence harmonic series.
          Therefore, since these terms are larger than the terms of a
          divergent series, this diverges by direct comparison.

          The alternating series test says that an alternating series
          converges if and only if the limit of the terms is zero. I
          calculate the limit of the terms. For this limit, I have to
          do some factorial algebra. I'll split up the factorial in
          the denominator into three pieces. 
        </p>
        <me>

        </me>
        <p>
          Let me look at these three pieces. In the first, piece, the
          <m>n!</m> cancels off, leaving just <m>1</m>. The third
          piece is simply <m>\frac{1}{2n+3}</m>. The middle piece is
          the most interesting. Here there are <m>n+1</m> numers in
          the numerator multiplied together and there are also
          <m>n+1</m> numbers in the denominator multiplied together.
          In the numerator, the numbers multiplied at all numbers up
          to <m>n+1</m>. In the denominator, the numbers multiplied
          together are the numbers starting with <m>n+1</m> and
          getting larger. Therefore, the product in the denominator
          must be larger than the product in the numerator and the
          fraction must be less than one. Putting it all together, I
          get constnat 1 multiplies by something less than one
          multiplied by <m>
          \frac{1}{2n+3}</m>, which approach zero. Therefore, the
          limit must be zero as well, which means that the series

          The alternating series test says that an alternating series
          converges if and only if the limit of the terms is zero. I
          calculate the limit of the terms.

          \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{n}} = 1
        </me>
        <p>
          The limit of the terms is not zero, so the sequence is
          divergent.

          I can simplify the terms by canceling with the factorial.

          \frac{(n+5)!}{(n+7)!} = \frac{1}{(n+6)(n+7)} = \frac{1}{n^2

          The asymptotic order of the terms is <m>\frac{1}{n^2}</m>,
          which are the terms of a convergent <m>\zeta</m> series.
          Therefore, this series converges.

        <p>
          The asymptotic order of the series is <m>\frac{n^2}{n^3} =
          \frac{1}{n}</m>. That is the harmonic series, which is
          divergence. Therefore, this series is divergent.

          This is an alternating series where the terms approach zero,
          so it converges.

          The asymptotic order of the terms is <m>\frac{n^6}{n^8} =

        <p>
          The asymptotic order of the terms of this series is

          series, which diverges. Therefore, this series diverges by

          \infty} \frac{n+1}{n} \frac{3^n}{3^{n+1}} = \frac{1}{3} 
        </me>
        <p>
          The limit is less than one, so the series converges.
