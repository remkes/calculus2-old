          The alternating series test says that an alternating series
          converges if and only if the limit of the terms is zero. I

          This is an asymptotic analysis limit and the order is the
          same in both numerator and denominator. The limit is the
          ratio of the leading terms. Since the limit is not zero, the
          series diverges by the alternating series test.

        <p>
          This is a limit of constant zeros, so it is certainly zero,
          and the series converges. (Adds up to 0, in fact, since it
          is just a sum of zeros!)

        <p>
          All three of these are geometric series. The common ratios
          are <m>\frac{1}{7}</m>. <m>\frac{2}{7}</m>, and
          <m>\frac{4}{7}</m>. All the common ratios are less than one,
          so all three series converge, and I conclude that the
          original series also converges.

        <p>
          The asymptotic order of the numerator is <m>\sqrt{n^6} =
          n^3</m>. The asymptotic order of the denominator is
          <m>\sqrt[3]{n^9} = n^3</m>. The limit here is the ratio of
          the leading coefficients, since the asymptotic order of the
          numerator is the same as the denominator. That ratio is 1.
          The limit of the terms is not zero, so by the test for
          divergence, the series diverges.

          \frac{\left| \frac{e^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \right|}{\left|

          The outcome of the ratio test is less than one, so the limit

          Asymptotically, the <m>\sin n</m> in the numerator doesn't
          affect the asymptotic order. The asymptotic order here is
          <m>\frac{1}{n^2}</m>. That's the asymptotic order of

        <p>
          Since the logarithm is a growing function, these terms are
          eventually larger than <m>\frac{1}{n-3}</m>. Those terms are
          (with a shift) the terms of the divergence harmonic series.
          Therefore, since these terms are larger than the terms of a
          divergent series, this diverges by direct comparison.

          The alternating series test says that an alternating series
          converges if and only if the limit of the terms is zero. I
          calculate the limit of the terms. For this limit, I have to
          do some factorial algebra. I'll split up the factorial in
          the denominator into three pieces. 
        </p>
        <me>

        </me>
        <p>
          Let me look at these three pieces. In the first, piece, the
          <m>n!</m> cancels off, leaving just <m>1</m>. The third
          piece is simply <m>\frac{1}{2n+3}</m>. The middle piece is
          the most interesting. Here there are <m>n+1</m> numers in
          the numerator multiplied together and there are also
          <m>n+1</m> numbers in the denominator multiplied together.
          In the numerator, the numbers multiplied at all numbers up
          to <m>n+1</m>. In the denominator, the numbers multiplied
          together are the numbers starting with <m>n+1</m> and
          getting larger. Therefore, the product in the denominator
          must be larger than the product in the numerator and the
          fraction must be less than one. Putting it all together, I
          get constnat 1 multiplies by something less than one
          multiplied by <m>
          \frac{1}{2n+3}</m>, which approach zero. Therefore, the
          limit must be zero as well, which means that the series

          Since this series is formed byadding positive elements to

          The terms are positive and greater than the terms of the

          In this limit, the asymptotic order of the numerator and

          The terms of this series are asymptotically equivalent to

          <m>\zeta</m> series with <m>p=\frac{3}{2}</m>. <m>\zeta</m>
          series converge when <m>p > 1</m>, so the series has terms
          which are asymptotically equivalent to a convergent
          <m>\zeta</m> series; therefore the series converges.

        <p>
          This is a very strange series and it isn't obvious what test
          might help. I found a comparison that works. For large
          enough <m>n</m>, <m>\ln n \gt 2</m>. If I invert this, I see
          that <m>\frac{1}{\ln n} \lt \frac{1}{2}</m>. Then if I
          apply the exponent <m>n</m>, I get 
          <me>
            \frac{1}{(\ln n)^n} \lt \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n 
          </me>
          This shows that the terms of this series are smaller than
          the terms <m>\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n</m>, which are the
          terms of a convergent geometric series (since the common
          ratio, <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>, is less than 1). Since all the
          terms of our series and the comparison series are positive,
          since there are terms which are smaller than the terms of a
          convergent series, this series will also converge.

          Alternatively, the root test is quite effective here (though
          I completely forgot about it while looking for the
          comparison above). 
          <me>
            \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sqrt[n]{ \left| \frac{1}{(\ln
            n)^n} \right| } = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\ln
            n} = 0 
          </me>
          Since this limits exists and is less than <m>1</m>, the root
          test tells me that the series converges.
