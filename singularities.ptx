    <title>Defining Singularities</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="example-apc1" />, the algebraic plane curve had a
      bunch of self intersections. What would the tangent line (and
      slope) be at such an intersection? This is the first example of a
      place where defining the tangent become problematic in a way that
      is different from a vertical tangent. There is a name for these
      places. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A point where the tangent line to an algebraic plane curve is
          not defined is called a <term>singularity</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Note one subtlety here: the a singularity is where the tangent
      <em>line</em> is not defined, not just where its <em>slope</em> is
      undefined. This means that points with vertical lines are not
      singularities; even though they don't have a slope, they do have a
      well defined tangent line. Singularities are points where the
      whole notion of a tangent line breaks down. The classification of
      singularities of algebraic plane curve is a old and historically
      important mathematical problem. This is particular true for cubics
      (algebraic plane curves of degree 3); the study of cubics led to
      whole branches of 19th and 20th century mathematics. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I get to cubics, let me cover the only possible singulary
      in degree two. In degree one, there are no problems: the tangent
      line to a line is just the original line, so this is always
      defined, even for a vertical line. Likewise, almost all degree two
      curves have no singularities: 
      circles, ellipses, parabolae and hyperbolae have no places where a
      tangent line cannot be undefined. There is only one kind of degree
      two curve which has a singularity: an intersection of two lines.
      An example, with the equation <m>x^2 - y^2 = 0</m>,  is shown in 
      <xref ref="figure-two-lines" />. 
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="figure-two-lines">

        <asymptote>
          size(10cm);

          import contour;
          import graph;
          xaxis(Ticks);
          yaxis(Ticks);

          real f(real x, real y) {return x^2 - y^2;} 
          draw(contour(f,(-3,-3),(3,3),new real[] {0}));
        </asymptote>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This strange degree two curve is just two lines. I can see this
      by factoring the equation: <m>x^2 - y^2 = 0</m> becomes
      <m>(x-y)(x+y) = 0</m>. This is just the product of two linear
      equations: <m>x-y=0</m> and <m>x+y=0</m>. Those two lines are
      the lines through the origin with slopes <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m>,
      respectively. These are clearly the lines in <xref
      ref="figure-two-lines" /> as well. This degree two curve is just
      two lines put together. (You may have noticed that I haven't
      called this a conic. It really isn't, since it is just two lines.
      I'll reserve the term <sq>conic</sq> for degree two curves which
      are not the product of two lines.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let me ask: what is the tangent line at the origin to the
      curve <m>x^2 - y^2 = 0</m>? This is a problem, since the line with
      slope <m>1</m> and the line with slope <m>-1</m> both seem to be
      tangent to parts of the curve. Therefore, the tangent line can't
      be properly defined. The origin is a singularity of this curve.
      There is a name for this type of singularity. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A singularity which is an intersection point of two or more
          pieces of an algebraic curve is called a <term>node</term>.
          The number of pieces at the intersection gives more precise
          names: two pieces is called a <term>double point</term>,
          three a <term>triple point</term>, and so on. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The curve <m>x^2 - y^2=0</m> has a double point node at the
      origin. In <xref ref="example-apc1" />, the picture in <xref
      ref="figure-apc3" /> looks like it has five different double
      point nodes. For an example of more than two intersecting pieces,
      consider the curve give by the following equation (shown in <xref
      ref="figure-apc4" />.

      The theory of singularities of algebraic plane curves is a deep
      and complicated one. Nodes are just one among many types of
      singularities. There are several others which have names, and many
      other singularities which don't have specific names but at
      classified by various catalogues and systems. Among those that
      have names, I want to define one more type of singularites. I'll
      give a less technical, more descriptive definition here.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A point on an algebraic plane curve which has a sharp corner
          (and is not the intersection of two or more pieces of the
          curve) is called a <term>cusp</term>.
        </p> 
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      A cusp can be seen in <xref ref="figure-apc5" /> at the origin on
      the curve <m>x^2 - y^3 = 0</m>. 
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="figure-apc5">

          draw(contour(g,(-2,-1),(2,1),new real[] {0}));
        </asymptote>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      At a node, there were multiple possibilities for a tangent based
      on the various pieces of the curve passing through the point. For
      a cusp, the situation is even worse. At a sharp corner, there are
      infinitly many lines that could be drawn that touch the curve only
      once. There notion of a slope at a sharp corner make any sense at
      all.

    <title>Investigating Singularities</title>
    <p>
      I would like to use the implicit derivatives defined in <xref
      ref="section-implicit-derivatives" /> to undertand singularities
      of algebraic plane curves. In general, as I said before, this is
      a deep and complicated theory. Since I don't have time to delve
      deeply into all of the various ways to use derivatives to
      understand singularities, I am going to specialize to a very
      particular class of curves. In this section, I'm only going to
      consider curves that have the following form, where <m>p(x)</m> is
      a polynomial of degree three or more.
    </p>
    <me>
      y^2 = p(x) 
    </me>
    <p>
      Even though this is specializing a great deal, it still allows
      for many interesting and important examples. The degree of the
      algebraic plane curve is still unbounded, since <m>p(x)</m> can
      have as high a degree as I want. If the degree of <m>p(x)</m>
      is three or four, the resulting curve is an elliptic curve (or,
      at least, one presentation of an elliptic curve). Elliptic
      curves are, themselves, an important branch of mathematics with
      many applications and connections. If the degree of <m>p(x)</m>
      is five or higher, the resulting curve is a hyperelliptic curve,
      another interesting and important type of object. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purposes of this course, curves of this form are
      accesible for several reasons. (I present the following
      statements without proof.) 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>
        All singularities and vertical tangents to these curve will
        always be on the <m>x</m> axis.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Vertical tangents and singularities are identified by places
        where the implicit derivative is not defined. 
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        At a point <m>(a,0)</m> where the implicit derivative is not
        defined, the limit <m>x \rightarrow a</m> of the implicit
        derivative approaching this point will classify the behaviour
        of the point.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        The only possibilites for the behaviour in this case are
        vertical tangents, double point nodes, or cusps. 
      </p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With these facts, I can build an algorithm to analyze the
      singularities of these special algebraic plane curves. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>
        I check the domain of possible <m>x</m> values that are
        allowed in the curve. This will have an impact on the
        directions of limits later in the process. 
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        I will take the implicit derivative.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        I will find the points <m>(a,0)</m> where the implicit
        derivative is undefined. 
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Using the equation of the orignal curve, I will replace
        <m>y</m> with <m>\pm \sqrt{p(x)}</m> in the expression for the
        implicit derivative. That gives an implicit derivative
        expressed entirely in <m>x</m>.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        I will take the limit <m>x \rightarrow a</m> of the implicit
        derivative.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        If this limit is <m>\pm \infty</m>, the slope of the tangent
        line is becoming steeper and steeper and I conclude there is
        vertical tangent.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        If this limit has two or more values (for example, because the
        <m>\pm</m> is still present in the final answer), then there
        are two or more possible tangent lines and I conclude this is
        a double point note.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        If this limit is zero, then I conclude there is a cusp. 
      </p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now I'll work through a number of examples to show this
      algorithm in practice. In this examples, note that if I can
      factor <m>p(x)</m> (or if it comes already factored), the
      calculations and the limits can become a lot easier due to
      cancelation of some of the factors. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the plane curve given by the equation <m>y^2 = 4 - 
          3x^2 - x^3</m>. This is a degree three curve, which factors as
          <m>y^2 = (1-x)(2+x)^2</m>. The domain is <m>x \leq 1</m>,
          since <m>x \geq 1</m> gives a negative on the right side,
          which is impossible with <m>y^2</m> on the left. I calculate
          the implicit derivative.
          <me>
            2 y \frac{dy}{dx} = -6x - 3x^2 \implies \frac{dy}{dx} =
            \frac{-6x-3x^2}{2y} = \frac{-3x(2+x)}{2y} 
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is well defined except when <m>y=0</m> which, for this
          curve, happens at <m>(1,0)</m> and <m>(-2,0)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I solve for <m>y</m> to get <m>y = \pm
          \sqrt{(1-x)(2+x)^2} = \pm (2+x)\sqrt{1-x} </m>. I use this
          to replace <m>y</m> in the implicit derivative.
          <me>
            \frac{dy}{dx} = \pm \frac{-3x(2+x)}{2\sqrt{1-x} (2+x)}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I look at the limits as I approach the undefined
          points. When <m>x=1</m>, only the denominator goes to
          <m>0</m>, the numerator is finite. Therefore, the 
          slope diverges to infinity and the curve will have a
          vertical tangent. Note that I can only take the limit
          approaching <m>x=1</m> from the left, due to the domain
          constraints, but the conclusion still holds.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, at <m>x=-2</m>, both numerator and denominator have a
          <m>x+2</m> term, which cancel out. (The limit is an
          indeterminate form of type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>). Evaluating
          the limit gives a slope of <m>\pm \frac{6}{2\sqrt{3}} = \pm
          \sqrt{3}</m>.  Since I get two values, this is a double
          point node. <xref ref="figure-elliptic-curve1" /> shows both
          the vertical tangent and the double point node that I have
          found with the limits of the implicit derivatives.

        <p>
          Consider the curve <m>y^2 = \frac{x^3}{4}</m>. This curve is
          only defined when <m>x /geq 0</m>, since negative <m>x</m>
          lead to a negative on the right side, which cannot happen
          with the square on the left. The implicit
          derivative is <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3x^2}{8y} =
          \pm \frac{3x^2}{4\sqrt{x^3}}</m>. This is undefined at the
