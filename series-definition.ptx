  <title>Definition and Convergence of Infinite Series</title>

    Now that I have introduced sequences and their limits, I can 
    define infinite series. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>\{a_n\}</m> is a sequence, then the sum of all
        infinitely many terms <m>a_n</m> is called an <term>infinite
        series</term>. Infinite series are usually written with sigma
        notation.

        \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n

      <p>
        The number <m>n</m> is called the <term>index</term> and the
        numbers <m>a_n</m> are called the <term>terms</term>. 
        Forgetting the sum produces the <term>sequence
        of terms</term> <m>\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m>. Though the above
        notation started with <m>n=1</m>, the series can have a
        starting index of any integer.

    <title>Partial-Sums and Convergence</title>
    <p>
      Unlike finite sums, there is no guarantee that an infinite
      series evaluates to anything. The problem of infinite series is
      precisely this: how can I add up infinitely many things? This
      isn't a problem that algebra can solve, but calculus, with the
      use of limits, can give a reasonable answer. I need to set up an
      approximation process and take the limit, just as I did for
      derivatives and integrals. The approximation process is called
      partial sums. Instead of taking the entire sum to infinity, I
      just take a sum of finitely many pieces.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <m>n</m>th <term>partial sum</term> of an infinite
          series is the sum of the first <m>n</m> terms.
        </p>
        <me>
          s_n := \sum_{k=1}^n a_k
        </me>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Since these are finite sums, I can actually calculate them.
      They serve as approximations to the total infinite sum.
      Moreover, these partial sums <m>\{s_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> define
      a sequence. I can take the limit of the sequence of partial
      sums. This is the limit of the approximation process, so it
      should calculate the value of the series.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The value of an infinite series is the limit of the sequence
          of partial sums, if the limit exists.

        </me>
        <p>
          If this limit exists, the series is <term>convergent</term>.
          Otherwise, the series is <term>divergent</term>.

          From these first few partial sum, I can claim that there is

        <p>
          I haven't proved this pattern of partial sums, but there is
          still a strong informal argument for it. (Proving the
          patterns of partial sums is often done through a proof
          technique called <term>mathematical induction</term>. This
          is an important proof technique and necessary for a more
          formal presentation of infinite series, but I'm not going to
          cover it in this course.) Now that I have a pattern for the
          partial sums, I can take the limit of the pattern to
          calculate the value of the infinite series.

          Unsurprisingly, I conclude that the total distance travelled
          from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m> is simply <m>1</m> unit. This
          gives a justification for saying that we <em>can</em> travel
          an infinite number of smaller and smaller intervals, since
          all those infinitely many intervals add up to a finite
          distance. (Whether this actually soves Zeno's paradox is a
          question left for the philosophers.)

          The harmonic series is divergent. This is something of a

          to the series defining Zeno's paradox. However, the terms
          of the harmonic series are large enough to eventually add up
          to something larger than any finite number.

          Zeno's paradox, this is a series where we simply can't
          reckon with the infinite numbers of steps. Since there is no
          last step in an finite process, I can never decide if the

    <title>The Test for Divergence</title>
    <p>
      As several examples have illustrated, it is possible for a
      divergent series to have terms which decrease to zero. 
      The comparsions between the geometric series
      with common ratio <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> and the harmonic series is
      an important comparison. The geometric series (which address
      Zeno's paradox) has terms <m>\frac{1}{2^n}</m>; these terms approach
      zero and the whole series adds up to exactly <m>1</m>. The
      harmonic series also has terms <m>\frac{1}{n}</m> which approach
      zero, but the series diverges. This leads to a very important
      observation: <em>the fact that the terms of a series decay to
      zero is not sufficient to conclude that the series
      converges</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inverse logical statement, however, does hold. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          (The Test for Divergence) Consider an infinite series.
        </p>
        <me>
          \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n
        </me>
        <p>
          Assume that the limit of the terms of the series is non
          zero. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \lim_{n \rightarrow a_n} \neq 0
        </me>
        <p>
          Under this assumption, the series must diverge. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      This is called the Test for Divergence because the logic here
      can only be used to prove divergence. If the limit of the terms
      is zero, I don't know if the series converges. If might be like
      the geometric series with common ratio <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> and
      converge. It might be like the harmonic series and diverge. I
      just don't know. However, if the limit of the terms is not zero,
      I know for certain that the series will diverge.

    <title>Two Central Examples</title>
    <p>
      There are two important classes of convergent series which I
      will use frequently. These two examples will be particularly
      important for future comparison results.  The first of the two
      examples has already been mentioned in connection with Zeno's
      paradox: the geometric series. I'll now give a full definition
      of is. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>r \in \RR</m>. The <term>geometric series</term>
          with common ratio <m>r</m> is this series.
        </p>
        <me>
          \sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n
        </me>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The geometric series with common ratio <m>r</m> converges to
          <m>\frac{1}{1-r}</m> as long as <m>|r| \lt 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        For <m>|r| \lt  1</m>, I will calculate the <m>k</m>th partial
        sums. In the calculation, I multiply by
        <m>\frac{1-r}{1-r}</m>. In the numerator, when I distribute the
        multiplication of the two terms, all but the very first and
        the very last products will cancel out, leaving a relatively 
        simple expression.
      </p>
      <me>
        s_k = 1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + \ldots + r^k = \frac{1-r}{1-r}
        \left( 1 + r + r^3 + r^3 + \ldots + r^k \right) =
        \frac{(1-r^k)}{1-r}
      </me>
      <p>
        The convergence of the series is shown by the limit of these
        partial sums.
      </p>
      <me>
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}
        \frac{1-r^k}{1-r} = \frac{1}{1-r}
      </me>
      <p>
        This limit is <m>\frac{1}{1-r}</m> only because of the
        assuming that <m>|r| \lt 1</m>. Under that assuming, the power
        of <m>r</m> in the numerator of the limit decay to zero,
        leaving the result as stated. 
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      The second important series is the <m>\zeta</m> (zeta)
      series. These are often called <m>p</m>-series in some texts.
      I call this the <m>\zeta</m> series since this definition, in
      a broader context, is the definition of the famous Riemann
      <m>\zeta</m> function.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <m>\zeta</m> series is the infinite series with terms
          <m>\frac{1}{n^p}</m>.
        </p>
        <me>
          \zeta(p) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^p}
        </me>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <m>\zeta</m> series converges when <m>p \gt 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      I state this without proof for now. The convergence of the
      <m>\zeta</m> series can be proved with the Integral Test in <xref
      ref="subsection-integral-test" />. Unlike the geometric series,
      where I can easily write the value, the actual value of
      <m>\zeta(p)</m> is not easy to express in conventional algebraic
      terms.
