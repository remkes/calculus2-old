  <title>Definition of Infinite Series</title>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>\{a_n\}</m> is a sequence,
        then the sum of all infinitely many terms <m>a_n</m> is called an
        <term>infinite series</term>.
        We write infinite series with sigma notation.
        <me>
          \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The number <m>n</m> is called the <term>index</term>
        and the numbers <m>a_n</m> are called the <term>terms</term>.
        If we want to forget the sum,
        we can talk about the <term>sequence of terms</term>
        <m>\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m>.
        Though we started with <m>n=1</m> in this definition,
        we could start with any integer.
