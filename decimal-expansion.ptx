  <title>Decimal Expansions for Real Numbers</title>
  <p>
    A nice application of infinite series is a proper and complete
    account of decimal expansions for real numbers. Such expansions
    have infinite length, so some of the standard problems involving
    infinite process are involved; limits are required.
  </p>
  <p>
    The starting question: what are decimal expansions and why do
    infinite strings of decimals actually represent numbers? A real
    number (in some setting, this is the definition) 
    is an expression <m>a.d_1d_2d_3d_4 \ldots</m>
    where <m>a \in \NN</m> and the <m>d_i</m> are digits in <m>\{0, 1,
    \ldots, 9\}</m>. (The digits could be in any base, of course, but
    the base 10 is conventional.) What is the meaning of this decimal
    notation? This is actually an infinite series. Let me write
    what the decimal expansion stands for. 
  </p>
  <me>
    a + \frac{d_1}{10} + \frac{d_2}{100} + \frac{d_3}{1000} +
    \frac{d_4}{10000} + \frac{d_5}{100000} + \ldots 
    = a + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{d_n}{10^n}
  </me>
  <p>
    Asymptotically, since the numerators are bounded by <m>9</m>, this
    series behaves like <m>\frac{1}{10^n}</m>. The terms
    <m>\frac{1}{10^n}</m> are terms of a geometric series with common
    ratio <m>\frac{1}{10}</m>, which is convergent, so the decimal
    expansion is also convergent. Therefore, I can be confident that
    all decimal expansions, though infinite, are convergent infinite
    series and do actually represent numbers. The infinity in decimals
    expansions is not a threat to their existence. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm going to finish this section by proving a notable and useful
    fact about real numbers. I'm going to start by thinking about the
    partial sums of a decimal expansion.
  </p>
  <me>
    s_n = a + \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{d_k}{10^k}
  </me>
  <p>
    These partial sums are all finite sums of fractions, hence they
    are rational numbers. Any real number <m>\alpha</m> is the limit
    of sums of this type, since its decimal expansion is the limit of
    the partial series sums. In some context, the following result is
    the definition of a real number.
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        All real numbers are limits of convergent sequences of
        rational numbers.
      </p>
