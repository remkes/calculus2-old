      <p>
        Consider the function <m>f(x) = \tan ((2x+1) \pi))</m> and the
        sequence <m>a_n = \tan ((2n + 1) \pi))</m>. Explain why the
        limit of the sequence makes sense and converges, but the limit
        of the function does not. Why does asymptotic analysis not
        help determine the limit of this function? (4)
