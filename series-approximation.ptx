  <title>Approximation and Taylor Polynomials</title>
  <p>
    In a Taylor series, instead of taking the terms and coefficients
    all the way to infinity, I could instead truncate the process at
    some degree.  The result is a polynomial. Moreover, since the
    partial sums are the approximation process for infinite series,
    this polynomial is an approximation to the Taylor series.

        If <m>f(x)</m> is analytic, its <m>d</m>th <term>Taylor
        polynomials</term> centered at <m>\alpha</m> is the truncation
        of its Taylor series, stopping at <m>(x-\alpha)^d</m>.

    Taylor polynomials give the best possible polynomial
    approximations to analytic functions. I'll give a couple examples.

        In <xref
        ref="figure-exponential-approximations">Figure</xref>, as the
        degree of the polynomial increases, the polynomial starts to
        match up with the graph of the exponential function more and
        more closely. Higher degree polynomials will give better and
        better approximations for more and more of the domain of the
        exponential function.

        The approximations for sine only have odd exponents, since
        there are only odd monomials in the Taylor series for sine.
        Therefore, I'll only calculate the odd Taylor polynomials here
        (the even Taylor polynomials simply add zero to the previous
        odd Taylor polynomial.  The graphs of the first few Taylor
        polynomials are shown in <xref

    The main application of approximation is calculating values of
    transcendental functions. I can't directly calculate their
    values using basic arithmetic; I need a method. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Polynomials are particularly useful as approximation tools since
    they involve only the basic operations of arithmetic. Computers
    can calculate with the basic operations of arithmetic, so
    computers can understand polynomials. If I want to program a
    computer or calculator to calculate values of <m>e^x</m> or
    <m>\sin x</m> or <m>\ln x</m> or some other transcendental
    function, Taylor series are one of the best techniques. Here are a
    couple examples of doing those approximations
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The logarithm is a transcendental function which can't be
        directly calculated. Here is a Taylor series for a particular
        version of the logarithm, which has a radius of convergence of
        <m>R = 1</m>.

        Using some clever arithmetic, I can write <m>\ln 2 = - \ln
        \frac{1}{2} = - \ln \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right)</m>. This
        lets me use this series to calculate <m>\ln 2</m> by
        evaluating at <m>x = \frac{1}{2}</m>.  Now I'll take the
        <m>6</m>th Taylor polynomial as an approximation 
        for <m>\ln 2</m>.

        This is not to far off from the value of <m>\ln 2 =
        0.69314\ldots</m>, accurate to the thousandths place. Already
        with a <m>6</m>th order approximation, this is already a
        usable approximation for many applications. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    I knew the accuracy of the previous approximation by comparing to
    a <sq>known value</sq>. That was a bit artificial, since the known
    value is really just a more accurate approximation. If I was
    calcualting something for the first time, how would I know how
    accurate my result it?
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the subject of error analysis of approximation methods.
    This is a major piece of mathematics in itself. Though I am not
    going to cover them here, there are theorems that give good
    understanding of the error of a Taylor polynomial approximation.
    Those theorems give confidence in approximations. I an
    approxmiation is needed that has some fixed precision, such an
    approximation can always be calculate with full confidence. This
    kind of mathematics is behind all the computer/calculator
    algorithms that calculate all values of logarithms,
    exponentials, square roots, etc.
