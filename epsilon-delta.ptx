      Our definition of limits in Calculus I was intuitive. The limit
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L
      </me>
      meant as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer to a, <m>f(x)</m> gets
      closer and closer to <m>L</m>. This is intuitive, since we
      haven't really said what this <sq>closer and closer</sq>
      actually means. 'Closer and closer' is only sense of movement
      <mdash/> not a formal definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some version of this limit definition have existed for two
      thousand years of mathematical history, from Zeno and Archimedes
      in ancient Greece through the early calculus into the 19th
      century. At some level, there were always concerns and
      problems: what did we actually mean by this <sq>closer and
      closer</sq>? A definitive answer was finally given by
      Weierstrass, who invented a technique now known as an
      epsilon-delta (<m>\epsilon-\delta</m>) arguments. The basic
      idea is to measure this <sq>closer and closer</sq>.
    </p>
    <p>
      What does <sq><m>x</m> is close to <m>a</m></sq> mean?
      According to Weierstass, it means there is some small positive
      number <m>\delta > 0</m> such that <m>|x-a| \lt \delta</m>.
      With this idea, we will present the definition of the limit now,
      formally, as an <m>\epsilon-\delta</m> argument.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L \text{ means } \forall
          \epsilon > 0 \ \ \exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that } |x-a|
          \lt  \delta \implies |f(x) - L| \lt  \epsilon
        </me>.
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This is the formal limit definition. Let's clarify what's going
      on in the notation. First: what do the numbers <m>\epsilon</m>
      and <m>\delta</m> do? They measure the <sq>closer and
      closer</sq> indicated in the intuitive limit. <m>\epsilon</m>
      is how close the function is to the limit value <m>L</m>, and
      <m>\delta</m> is how close the input is to the value <m>a</m>.
      They are always thought of as <em>very small</em> positive
      numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, we have quantifiers: <m>\forall</m> means <sq>for
      all</sq> and <m>\exists</m> means <sq>there exists</sq>.
      Moreover, the order of the quantifiers is very important. The
      start of the definition reads: for any (small) <m>\epsilon</m>,
      there exists a (small) <m>\delta</m>. That means that
      <m>\delta</m> is chosen in response to <m>\epsilon</m>. This
      creates a kind of game: the limit definition says that no matter
      what <m>\epsilon</m> you choose, in response, I can choose a
      <m>\delta</m> to make it work. <m>\delta</m> is dependant on
      <m>\epsilon</m> because of the order of the qualifiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, we have the two inequalities: these are the measure of
      how close we are. The order and the implication here is
      important: being close in <m>x</m> to <m>a</m> implies that we
      are close in <m>f(x)</m> to <m>L</m>. This matches the
      intuitive notion of the limit: closeness in <m>x</m> implies
      closeness in <m>f(x)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting it together, we get this idea: no matter how close you
      want to be (<m>\epsilon</m>) to <m>L</m>, we can find a distance
      (<m>\delta</m>) to <m>a</m> such that starting <m>x</m> within
      <m>\delta</m> of <m>a</m>, we will have <m>f(x)</m> within
      <m>\epsilon</m> of <m>L</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let's start with a simple limit.
          <me>
            \lim_{x \rightarrow 2} 4x = 8
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to know how to choose <m>\delta</m> in response to
          <m>\epsilon</m>. If, for example, <m>\epsilon =
          \frac{1}{10}</m> then take <m>\delta = \frac{1}{40}</m>.
          This allows a calculation of the relative closenesses.
          <me>
            |x-2| \lt  \frac{1}{40} \implies |4x-8| = 4 |x-2| \lt  4
            \frac{1}{40} = \frac{1}{10}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can generalize this calculation. If we are given an
          <m>\epsilon</m>, we can choose <m>\delta =
          \frac{\epsilon}{4}</m> such that
          <me>
            |x-2| \lt  \delta \implies |4x-8| = 4 |x-2| \lt  4 \delta
            = \epsilon
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This example shows the general technique: we choose
          <m>\delta</m> depending on <m>\epsilon</m>, and then argue
          that this choice of <m>\delta</m> gives the implication
          <m>|x-a| \lt \delta \implies |f(x) - L| \lt \epsilon</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow 2} x^2 = 4
        </me>.
        <p>
          This one is a bit more challenging, since the choice of
          <m>delta</m> is a little more subtle. Given
          <m>\epsilon</m>, we can choose <m>\delta</m> to be
          either <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> or <m>\frac{\epsilon}{5}</m>,
          whichever is smaller. Since we insist that <m>\epsilon \leq
          \frac{1}{2}</m>, <m>|x-2|\lt \delta</m> implies that
          <m>x</m> is close to <m>2</m>, so <m>x+2</m> is close to
          <m>4</m>. In particular, we know that <m>|x+2|\lt 5</m>.
          This gives us the two necessary pieces which we use in prove
          the limit implication.
          <me>
            |x-2| \lt  \delta \implies |x^2-4| = |(x-2)(x+2)| =
            |x-2||x+2| \lt  5 \frac{\epsilon}{5} = \epsilon
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>

    <title>Infinite Limits</title>
    <p>
      For limits which diverge to <m>\infty</m>, or limits as <m>x
      \rightarrow \infty</m>, we need to replace the
      <m>\epsilon-\delta</m> definition by a similar definition. With
      infinite limits, the intuition is no longer <sq>getting closer
      and closer</sq>. Instead, the intuition is that the values are
      <sq>getting larger and larger without bound</sq>. That is
      encoded by saying that for any natural number <m>M</m> or
      <m>N</m>, we will eventually exceed <m>M</m> or <m>N</m>. With
      this idea, we can encode the following limit statements
      formally.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x) = L \text{ means } \forall
          \epsilon > 0 \exists M \in \NN \text{ such that }  x > M
          \implies |f(x) - L| \lt  \epsilon
        </me>.
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = \infty \text{ means } \forall
          N \in \NN \exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that }  |x-a| \lt
          \delta \implies f(x) > N
        </me>.
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x) = \infty \text{ means }
          \forall N \in \NN 0 \exists M \in \NN \text{ such that }  x
          > M \implies f(x) > N
        </me>.
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In using the definition, we always tell how to choose the second
      quantity based on the first (<m>M</m> in terms of
      <m>\epsilon</m>, <m>\delta</m> in terms of <m>N</m> or <m>M</m>
      in terms of <m>N</m>, respectively). Then we use the
      relationship between the two terms (with some algebra with
      absolute values and inequalities) to prove the desired
      implication.
