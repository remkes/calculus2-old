      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate the volume of a cone of height <m>h</m> and base
          radius <m>R</m>. 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          I will assume the cone is pointing along the <m>y</m> axis
          with its base at <m>y=h</m> and its tip at <m>y=0</m>. (This
          standing the cone on its end is a bit odd, but it makes the
          integral easier.) 
          Horizontal slices (at various <m>y</m> values) have circular
          cross sections. The radius of each horizontal slice grows
          linearly from <m>0</m> are the origin to <m>R</m> at height
          <m>y = h</m>. This slope is <m>r = \frac{Ry}{h}</m>, so I
          can use this the radius term. The area is <m>\pi r^2</m> and
          the range is <m>y \in [0,h]</m>. Now I can setup the
          integral. 
        </p>
        <me>
          V = \int_0^h \frac{\pi y^2 r^2}{h^2} dy 
        </me>
        <p>
          This is a reasonable polynomial integral. 
        </p>
        <me>
          V = \frac{\pi r^2}{h^2} \int_0^h y^2 dy = \frac{\pi
          r^2}{h^3} \frac{y^3}{3} \Bigg|_0^h = \frac{\pi
          r^2}{h^2} \frac{h^3}{3} = \frac{\pi r^2 h}{3}

          Calculate the volume of a surface of revolution formed by
          rotating the function <m>f(x) = \ln x</m> about the <m>x</m>
          axis in the range <m>x \in [1, e^2]</m>

          V = \int_a^b \pi (f(x))^2 dx 
        </me>

          The function and the range are given, so I can just proceed
          with the integral.

          V = \int_1^{e^2} A dh = \int_1^{e^2} \pi (ln x)^2 dx = \pi

        </me>
        <p>
          I will integrate by parts, with <m>f = \ln x</m> and
          <m>\frac{dg}{dx}  = \ln x</m>, so that <m>\frac{df}{dx} =
          \frac{1}{x}</m> and <m>g = x \ln x - x</m>. (The
          antiderivative of the logarithm is from the tables.) Then I
          can proceed with the integral.

        <p>
          Calculate the volume of a tetrahedron of side length
          <m>a</m>. (This is a particularly difficult activity; feel
          free to attempt it, but don't be discouraged if you don't
          make easy progress.) 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The geometry is difficult to set up, and there are many
          approaches.  I set one of the faces to be the base. On
          that face, I'll let <m>b</m> be the distance from a vertex of
          that face to the centre of the same face. I can split this
          face into three isoceles trianges, each of which has side
          lengths <m>b</m>, <m>b</m> and <m>a</m>, with angles
          <m>\pi/6</m>, <m>\pi/6</m> and <m>2\pi/3</m>. I apply the
          sine law to this triangle.
        </p>
        <me>
          \frac{a}{\sin \frac{2\pi}{3}} = \frac{b}{\sin \frac{\pi}{6}}
          \implies \frac{a}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{1}{2} 
        </me>
        <p>
          This implies <m>b = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}</m>. Then there is a
          right triangle whose vertical are one vertex of the base,
          the centre of the base, and the top vertex. This triangle
          has hypotenuese <m>a</m>, base <m>b</m> and height <m>c</m>
          where <m>c</m> is the height of tetrahedron, from the center
          of the base to the top vertex. Pythagorus allows me to
          calculate c: <m>c = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}
          a</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm going to slice the tetrahedron with horizontal plane
          slices, stacked vertical. The previous calculation for
          <m>c</m> gives us a bound for integration, so the integral
          goves from <m>0</m> to <m>\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}a</m>.  I'll
          work with the variable <m>h</m> for height. Because it is
          convenient, I'll say that <m>h</m> starts at zero at the top
          vertex, and goes to <m>\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}a</m> at the base.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have to do some geometry to find the area of each slice.
          slice. Each slice is an equilateral triangle, but what is
          the side length (depending on <m>h</m>)? Recall the base
          triangle: it has side length <m>a</m> when <m>h =
          \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}a</m>. This side length increases linearly
          from <m>0</m> when <m>h=0</m> to <m>a</m> when <m>h =
          \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}a</m>. The final result gives the solve of
          the linear relationship.  Therefore, for <m>h \in [0,
          \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}a ]</m>, the side length of the triangle
          at height <m>h</m> is <m>\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}h</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An equilateral triangle with side length <m>s</m> is
          <m>\frac{\sqrt{3}a^2}{4}</m>. This gives the area of each
          slice. 
        </p>
        <me>
          A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \left( \sqrt{ \frac{3}{2}} h
          \right)^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \frac{3}{2} h^2 =
          \frac{3\sqrt{3}h^2}{8}
        </me>
        <p>
          Then I can setup the integral of the slices.

          V = \int_0^{\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}a} A(h) dh =

        </me>
        <p>
          This is a reasonable polynomial integral.
        </p>
        <me>
          V = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \int_0^{\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}a} h^2 dh
          = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \frac{h^3}{3}
          \Bigg|_0^{\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}a}  
          = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8} \left( \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} a \right)^3
          = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8} \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3\sqrt{3}} a^3 =
          \frac{a^3}{6\sqrt{2}}

          Calculate the volume of the object formed by taking the
          triangle with vertices <m>(3,0)</m>, <m>(5,0)</m> and
          <m>(3,4)</m> and rotating it about the <m>y</m> axis. 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          I need to determine the function to use for cylindrical
          shells. The height of the triangle over the <m>x</m> axis is
          given by the diagonal line from <m>(3,4)</m> to <m>(5,0)</m>. 
          That line has equation <m>y = -2x + 10</m>.
          Therefore, I can take <m>f(x) = -2x + 10</m> as the function.
          The function is the height of the cylinder, and its
          circumference is <m>2\pi x</m>. Its area is <m>2\pi x
          f(x)</m>. Then I set up the integral. The resulting integral
          is a reasonable polynomial integral.
