    <title>Series as Functions</title>
    <p>
      The two main examples for comparison in <xref
      ref="subsection-comparison" />
      were the geometric series and the <m>\zeta</m> series. Both
      converged for certain values of a parameter; <m>|r|\lt 1</m>
      for the geometric series and <m>p ></m> for the <m>\zeta</m>
      series. To start this section, I'd like to re-interpret these
      two series. Instead of thinking of a whole family of different
      series which depend on a parameter (<m>r</m> or <m>p</m>), I
      can think of each family of series as a <em>function</em> of the
      parameter. In this view, there is only one series, but the
      series converges tofunction instead of just a number.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the geometric series, this new perspective defines a
      function <m>f(x)</m>.
    </p>
    <me>
      f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n
    </me>
    <p>
      The domain of this function is <m>|x|\lt 1</m>, since those are
      the values of the parameter (now the variable) where the
      geometric series converges. Since I know the value of the
      geometric series, I actually already have another expression for
      this function.
    </p>
    <md>
      <mrow>
        \amp f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n = \frac{1}{1-x} \amp \amp 
        |x| \lt 1
      </mrow>
    </md>
    <p>
      In this way, the geometric series now defines the function
      <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m>. The domain restriction of the
      function is determined by the convergence of the series: a point
      <m>x</m> is in the domain of the function if the series
      converges for that choice of <m>x</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can do the same with the <m>\zeta</m> series. The reason I
      called these series <sq><m>\zeta</m> series</sq> is that the
      associated function is called the Riemann <m>\zeta</m>-function.
    </p>
    <me>
      \zeta(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n^x}
    </me>
    <p>
      The domain of this function is <m>(1,\infty)</m>, since that is
      where the series converges. (In other branches of mathematics,
      the domain of <m>\zeta</m> is extended in new and interesting
      ways. The vanishing of the <m>\zeta</m> function is the subject
      of the famous Riemann Hypothesis, an important unsolved problem
      in modern mathematics.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, an infinite series can represent a function
      <m>f(x)</m> when the terms <m>a_n</m> of the series also depend
      on <m>x</m>.
    </p>
    <me>
      f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n(x)
    </me>
    <p>
      Notice that the variable of the function, <m>x</m>, is not the
      index of the sum <m>n</m>. These two numbers are different and
      must not be confused. The domain of this function is the set of
      values of <m>x</m> for which the series converges. Instead of
      the conventions for determining the domains of functions used
      before (avoiding division by zero, square
      roots and other problems) domain restrictions for these new
      funcdtions are all about
      convergence. For these series, convergence is no longer a
      yes/no question. Instead, it is a domain question: for which
      real numbers does the series converge?

    <title>Radii of Convergence</title>
    <p>
      Polynomials are defined for all real numbers; they had no
      domain restrictions. However, series do have domain
      restrictions. A power series may or may not converge for all
      real values of <m>x</m>. The first and most important issue
      when I start using series as functions is determining the
      domain of convergence. For power series, I will almost always
      use the ratio test. Recall that the ratio tests shows
      convergence when the limit of the ratio of the terms is <m>\lt
      1</m>. I will use some examples to show the various types of
      behaviours.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>

          Here is a power series centred at <m>\alpha = -2</m>. I'll

          the series diverges and doesn't represent a function. The
          convergence at the endpoints <m>-3</m> and <m>-1</m> is

          The ratio test allows me to conclude that this converges on

              <p>

                It will diverge outside this interval, and the
                behaviour at the end points is undetermined and has to
                be checked individually.

          The positive real number <m>R</m> in the third case is
          called the <term>radius of convergence</term> of a power
          series. I can use this terminology to cover the other two
          cases as well: in the first case, I can say <m>R=0</m> and in

      For power series, the most important things to do is to
      determine the radius of convergence. This determines the domain
      of the function defined by the series. I'll do some examples. In
      each example, I'll define a series and calculate its convergence
      using the ratio test.

    <title>Properties of Power Series</title>
    <p>
      Inside the radius of convergence, a power series has all the
      properties of a normal function. I can add and subtract two
      power series as long as I remain inside the radii of both
      series. I can multiply as well, though the calculations become
      difficult. The same is true for division: if a series is
      non-zero inside its radius of convergence, I can divide by the
      series (though the results of the calculation are difficult to
      use).
    </p>
    <p>
      Other properties of series can be calculated with various ease
      or difficulty, depending on the series. I can investigate the
      growth of series, whether or not they are bounded, symmetric or
      periodic, and whether or not they are invertible. The key idea
      to remember is that power series, inside their radii of
      convergence, are functions; anything that applies to functions
      can be applied to power series.

    <title>Calculus of Power Series</title>
    <p>
      Since power series are functions, I can try to do calculus with
      them, investigating their limits, continuity, derivatives and
      integrals. It turns out that one of major advantages of working
      with power is that their calculus is remarkably approachable. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
         Consider power series centered at <m>\alpha</m>.
        </p>
        <me>
          f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n (x-\alpha)^n
        </me>
        <p>
          This <m>f</m> is a continuous function inside its radius of
          convergence. In addition, <m>f</m> is infinitely
          differentiable inside its radius of convergence.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      There is a convenient notation for differentiability which I
      will use frequently, particularly in future courses.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is a function on a domain <m>D</m> and the
          <m>n</m>-th derivative of <m>f</m> is defined and
          continuous, then <m>f</m> is in the class <m>C^n(D)</m>.
          If the domain is understood implicitly, I just say <m>f</m>
          is in the class <m>C^n</m>. If <m>f</m> is infinitely
          differentiable, then<m>f</m> is in the class
          <m>C^\infty</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The proposition says that power series are in class
      <m>C^\infty</m>, but how are these derivatives calculated? 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is a power series, then then derivative of
          <m>f</m> is calculated term-wise, simply by differentiating
          every term in the series.
        </p>
        <me>
          f^\prime(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n n(x-\alpha)^{n-1}
        </me>
        <p>
          Therefore, the derivative is a power series as well;
          moreover, it will have the same radius of convergence as the
          original.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Integration is just as pleasant for power series.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is a power series centered at <m>\alpha</m>,
          then <m>f</m> is integrable and its indefinite integral is
          calculated termwise. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \int f(x) dx= \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n
          \frac{(x-\alpha)^{n+1}}{n+1} + C
        </me>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      The simplicity of integration is particularly helpful. As
      previous sections of this course have amply demonstrated,
      integration is difficult business. For functions which be
      expressed as series, integration is almost trivial. This makes
      power series a very useful and convenient class of functions.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-series-patterns-exponents">
    <title>Series with Patterns of Exponents</title>
    <p>
      If it often the case that a power series may contain non-zero
      terms only for certain exponents following some pattern. In this
      section, I'm going to briefly introduce some common notation for
      particular cases of this phenomenon. Consider a series where all
      the odd terms are zero (centered at <m>0</m> for convenience). 
      <me>
        f(x) = c_0 + 0x + c_2x^2 + 0x^3 + c_4x^4 + 0x^5 + \ldots 
      </me>
      I could similarly consider a series where all the even terms
      are zero. 
      <me>
        f(x) = 0 + c_1x + 0 + c_3x^3 + 0x^4 + c_45^5 + 0x^6 + \ldots 
      </me>
      If I want to index all the even numbers, I can write <m>k =
      2n</m> for <m> n \in \NN</m>. Similarly, I can index all the
      odd numbers by writing <m>k = (2n+1)</m> for <m>n \in \NN</m>.
      Using these tools, I could write a series with only odd or even
      non-zero terms. The series
      <me>
        f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_{2n} (x-\alpha)^{2n}
      </me>
      is a series with only even terms. The series.
      <me>
        g(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_{2n-1} (x-\alpha)^{2n+1}
      </me>
      is a series with only odd terms. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some extra care must be taken with calculating radii of
      convergence for these series. The formula
      <me>
        R = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left| \frac{c_n}{c_{n+1}}
        \right| 
      </me>
      relies on the assumption that all <m>c_n \neq 0</m>. This is not
      true for these series with only odd term or even terms. For
      series with such patterns, I need a slightly different approach.
      Take the example series
      <me>
        f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_{2n} (x-\alpha)^{2n}
      </me>
      that only has even terms. Implicitly, even though I can assume
      <m>c_{2n} \neq 0</m>, all of the missing coefficient
      <m>c_{2n+1}</m> are zero.  To use the calculation for radius of
      convergence, a series needs all non-zero coefficients. I can
      force this series into such a form by some clever manipulation
      of exponents. Using the laws of exponents, I adjust the power of
      <m>(x-\alpha)</m>.
      <me>
        f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_{2n} ((x-\alpha)^2)^{n}
      </me>
      Then I also re-index the coefficients: what I called
      <m>c_{2n}</m> before, I'll just call <m>c_n</m>.
      <me>
        f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_{n} ((x-\alpha)^2)^{n}
      </me>
      Then this is a series with all non-zero coefficients (with the
      assumption that the original <m>c_{2n}</m> were non-zero).
      However, it is now a power series in <m>x^2</m>, not <m>x</m>.
      Therefore, if I calculate a radius of convergence <m>R</m>, the
      resulting inequality is
      <me>
        (x-\alpha)^2 \in \left( - R, R \right)
      </me>
      To get the actual bound on <m>x</m> itself requires manipulating
      the inequalities that bound <m>x^2</m>. The result is this.
      <me>
        (x-\alpha) \in \left( - \sqrt{R}, \sqrt{R} \right) \implies 
        x \in \left( \alpha - \sqrt{R}, \alpha + \sqrt{R} \right) 
      </me>
      In summary, there is often a way to get to a domain of convergence
      for this type of series, but it can be difficult and unwieldy. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The approach above doesn't just work for even and odd terms.
      Using similar ideas, I could encode all sorts of patterns in the
      exponents of our power series. If a power series had non-zero
      terms only when the exponent was a power of <m>3</m>, I could
      write it as
      <me>
        f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (x-\alpha)^{3n}
      </me>.
      If the power series had non-zero exponents only for every fifth
      number starting at <m>7</m>, I could write it as
      <me>
        f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (x-\alpha)^{5n + 7}
      </me>.
      In either case, I'd have to use similar kinds of tricks to
      reduce it to a series in <m>x^3</m> or <m>x^5</m>, then
      calculate the radius, then manipulate the inequalities to figure
      out the actual bounds on <m>x</m>.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-non-elementary-functions">
    <title>Non-Elementary Functions</title>
    <p>
      One of the uses of power series is to construct entirely new
      functions. These are often called non-elementary functions (the
      elementary functions are those which we already have worked
      with: polynomials, roots, exponentials, logarithms, trig, and
      hyperbolics). Here are some examples.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The Bessel functions of order <m>k \in \NN</m> are given by
          this series.
          <me>
            J_k(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n}}{2^{2n+k}
            ((n+k)!)^2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bessel functions are like the trigonometric functions,
          but the terms in the denominators are larger. They oscilate
          like trig functions, but with decaying amplitude. They are
          important for spherical and circular waves, such as sound
          waves or ripples on a pond.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

            C_k(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\pi (k+n) x^n}{n!}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The Polylogarithm functions are given by this series. (Note
          that for <m>s=1</m> the polylogarithm is <m>Li_1(x) = -\ln
          (1-x)</m>, the conventional logarithm).
          <me>
            Li_s(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^{n}}{n^s}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      These three examples are just the very start of a huge world of
      non-elementary functions.
