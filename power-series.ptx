    <title>Series as Functions</title>
    <p>
      Our two main examples for comparison in the previous chapter
      were the geometric series and the <m>\zeta</m> series. Both
      converged for certain values of the parameter; <m>|r|\lt 1</m>
      for the geometric series and <m>p ></m> for the <m>\zeta</m>
      series. To start this section, I'd like to re-interpret these
      two series. Instead of thinking of a whole family of different
      series which depend on a parameter (<m>r</m> or <m>p</m>), we
      can think of each family of series as a <em>function</em> of the
      parameter. In this view, we have only one series, but the
      series produces a function instead of just a number.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the geometric series, this new perspective defines a
      function <m>f(x)</m>.
      <me>
        f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The domain of this function is <m>|x|\lt 1</m>, since those are
      the values of the parameter (now the variable) where the
      geometric series converges. We even know what this function
      is:
      <me>
        f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n = \frac{1}{1-x} \hspace{2cm} |x|
        \lt 1
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, the geometric series now defines the function
      <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}</m>. The domain restriction of the
      function is determined by the convergence of the series: a point
      <m>x</m> is in the domain of the function if the series
      converges for that choice of <m>x</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can do the same with the <m>\zeta</m> series. The reason we
      called them <m>\zeta</m> series is that the associated function
      is called the Riemann <m>\zeta</m>-function.
      <me>
        \zeta(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n^x}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The domain of this function is <m>(1,\infty)</m>, since that is
      where the series converges. (In other branches of mathematics,
      the domain of <m>\zeta</m> is extended in new and interesting
      ways. The vanishing of the <m>\zeta</m> function is the subject
      of the famous Riemann Hypothesis, an important unsolved problem
      in modern mathematics.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, an infinite series can represent a function
      <m>f(x)</m> when the terms <m>a_n</m> of the series also depend
      on <m>x</m>.
      <me>
        f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n(x)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that the variable of the function, <m>x</m>, is not the
      index of the sum <m>n</m>. These two numbers are different and
      must not be confused. The domain of this function is the set of
      values of <m>x</m> for which the series converges. Instead of
      previous domain restrictions, involving division by zero, square
      roots and other problems, domain restrictions are now all about
      convergence. For these series, convergence is no longer a
      yes/no question. Instead, it is a domain question: for which
      real numbers does the series converge?

    <title>Radii of Convergence</title>
    <p>
      Polynomials were defined for all real numbers; they had no
      domain restrictions. However, series do have domain
      restrictions. A power series may or may not converge for all
      real values of <m>x</m>. The first and most important issue
      when we start using series as functions is determining the
      domain of convergence. For power series, we will almost always
      use the ratio test. Recall that the ratio tests shows
      convergence when the limit of the ratio of the terms is <m>\lt
      1</m>. We will use some examples to show the various types of
      behaviours.

          This series is centered at <m>\alpha=-2</m>, and the ratio
          test tells us that we have convergence on <m>|x+2|\lt 1</m>,
          which is the interval <m>(-3,-1)</m>. Outside the interval,
          the series diverges and doesn't represent a function. The
          convergence at the endpoints <m>-3</m> and <m>-1</m> is

    <title>Properties of Power Series</title>
    <p>
      Inside the radius of convergence, a power series has all the
      properties of a normal function. We can add and subtract two
      power series as long as we remain inside the radii of both
      series. We can multiply as well, though the calculations become
      difficult. The same is true for division: if a series is
      non-zero inside its radius of convergence, we can divide by the
      series (though the results of the calculation are difficult to
      use).
    </p>
    <p>
      Other properties of series can be calculated with various ease
      or difficulty, depending on the series. We can investigate the
      growth of series, whether or not they are bound, symmetric or
      periodic, and whether or not they are invertible. The key idea
      to remember is that power series, inside their radii of
      convergence, are functions; anything that applies to functions
      can be applied to power series.

          continuous, we say that <m>f</m> is in class <m>C^n(D)</m>.
          If the domain is understood implicitly, we just say <m>f</m>
          is in class <m>C^n</m>. If <m>f</m> is infinitely
          differentiable, we say <m>f</m> is in class
          <m>C^\infty</m>.
        </p>

      The proposition says that power series are in class
      <m>C^\infty</m>, but how are these derivatives calculated? The
      answer is as nice as possible.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is a power series, then then derivative of
          <m>f</m> is calculated term-wise, simply by differentiating
          every term in the series.
          <me>
            f^\prime(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n n(x-\alpha)^{n-1}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the derivative is a power series as well;
          moreover, it will have the same radius of convergence as the
          original.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Integration is just as pleasant for power series.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is a power series centered at <m>\alpha</m>,
          then <m>f</m> is integrable and its indefinite integral is
          calculated termwise. 
          <me>
            \int f(x) dx= \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n
            \frac{(x-\alpha)^{n+1}}{n+1} + C
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      The simplicity of integration is particularly helpful. As we
      saw in Calculus II, integration is difficult business. For
      functions which be expressed as series, integration is almost
      trivial. This makes power series a very useful and convenient
      class of functions.
