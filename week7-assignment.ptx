        For the resulting integral, you can use this antiderivative
        instead of doing all of the work of a trig substitution.

        \int \sqrt{a^2 + b^2t^2} dt = \frac{t}{2} \sqrt{a^2 + b^2t^2}
        + \frac{a^2}{b^2} \ln \left| \frac{bt}{a} +
        \sqrt{\frac{b^2t^2}{a^2} + 1} \right| + c

        The result you will get from this integral will be a
        complicated expression with square roots and logarithms. Leave
        your answer in this form; do not change it into decimals.

        Consider these two parametric curves. (8)

          \amp \gamma(t) = \left( \frac{\cos t}{t^2}, \frac{\sin
          t}{t^2}

        Both of these are inward spirals, but they spiral inwards at
        different rates. Prove that <m>\gamma_1</m> has infinite
        length but <m>\gamma_2</m> has finite length. 
      </p>
      <p>A couple hints for this questions: First, recall from the
        section on improper integrals that convergence of integrals is
        detemined by the asymptotic order of the integrand. For these,
        you need to setup the length integral for each curve, but you
        don't actually need to do that calculation. Instead, find the
        asymptotic order of each integrand and use the examples
        from the section on improper integrals to determine whether or
        not they converge: if the integral converges, the length is
        finite and if it diverges, the length is infinite. Second,
        when you are calculating <m>\sqrt{x^\prime(t)^2 +
        y^\prime(t)^2}</m> for each of these, expect long expressions
        with lots of trig terms. However, using trig identities, these
        expression will collapse down into much more concise
        expressions without any trig functions left.
