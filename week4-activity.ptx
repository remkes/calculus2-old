    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate this integral.
          <me>
            \int 3x^2 (x^3 - 4)^5 dx 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The second part of this integrand looks like a composition:
          <m>(x^3 - 4)^5</m> is an inside function, with an
          outside function <m>u^5</m>. Moreover, the remaining piece
          of the integral looks like it might be the derivative of the
          inside, which is idea for the substitution rule. Here is the
          substitution. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              u \amp = x^3 - 4 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              du \amp = 3x^2 dx 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          I can rearrange the original integral to match these
          pieces, then do the replacement. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \int 3x^2 (x^3 - 4)^5 dx \amp = \int (x^3-4)^4 (3x^2 dx) 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \int u^5 du = \frac{u^6}{6} + c
            </mrow>
          </md>
          At the end, I undo the substitution to return to the
          original variable. 
          <me>
            \frac{u^6}{6} + c = \frac{(x^3-4)^6}{6} + c 
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate this integral.
          <me>
            \int \cos (17 x) dx 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The integrand is a composition with inside <m>(17x)</m> and
          outside <m>\cos (u)</m>. We'll try a substitution with these
          pieces. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              u \amp = 17 x 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              du \amp = 17 dx 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \frac{1}{17} du \amp = dx 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          I had to move the 17 to the left, since the original
          integral doesn't have a term which looks like <m>17 dx</m>.
          In this form, however, I can replace all the piece of the
          original integral with the new variable. 
          <me>
            \int \cos (17 x) dx = \int \cos u \frac{1}{17} du 
          </me>
          Then I can use linearity and known antideriatives to do the
          integral. 
          <me>
            = \frac{1}{17} \sin (u) + c 
          </me>
          Finally, I reverse the substitution.
          <me>
            = \frac{1}{17} \sin (17 x) + c 
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate this integral.
          <me>
            \int \frac{x-4}{x-5} dx 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This doesn't look like a composition. However, substitution
          is sometime still useful even when I don't obviously have a
          composition. Here, I'm going to take the denominator as the
          substitution, to try to produce an easier integral. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              u \amp = x - 5
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              du \amp = dx
            </mrow>
          </md>
          I also need to know how to replace the numerator. 
          <me>
            u = x - 5 \implies u + 1 = x - 4 
          </me>
          Now I can replace all the piece of the original integral. 
          <me>
            \int \frac{x-4}{x-5} dx = \int \frac{u+1}{u} du 
          </me>
          Now that I have a simpler denominator, I can split the
          numerator up to give two integrals, using linearity. 
          <me>
            = \int \frac{u}{u} + \frac{1}{u} du = \int 1 du + \int
            \frac{1}{u} du 
          </me>
          Then I use known antiderivatives. 
          <me>
            = u + \ln |u| + c 
          </me>
          Finally, I reverse the substitution.
          <me>
            = (x-5) + \ln |x-5| + c 
          </me>
          As a final note, I could group the <m>(-5)</m> with the
          constant, like this:
          <me>
            = x + \ln |x-5| + (c - 5)
          </me>
          If I did that, since the constant can be set to any real
          number, subtracting 5 doesn't make a difference. Therefore,
          an alternative form of the answer gets ride of this
          <m>(-5)</m>.
          <me>
            = x + \ln |x-5| + c 
          </me>
          This certinaly isn't necessary, but I mention it here since
          these kinds of steps with constants of integration are
          commonly done. 
        </p>
      </solution>
    </activity>
    <activity>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Calculate this integral.
          <me>
            \int_0^1 2x(x^2 + 4)^3 dx
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This looks like a composition with inside function
          <m>(x^2+4)</m> and outside function <m>u^3</m>. The rest of
          the integrand looks like it might be close to the derivative
          of the inside function, which is promising. We proceed with
          the substitution rule. Now I will also change the bounds. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              u \amp = x^2 + 4
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              du \amp = 2x dx
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              x \amp = 0 \implies u = (0)^2 + 4 = 4 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              x \amp = 1 \implies u = (1)^2 + 4 = 5 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          I can rearrange the integral so that I can substitute all
          the pieces clearly. 
          <me>
            \int_0^1 2x(x^2 + 4)^3 dx = \int_0^1 (x^2+4)^3 (2x dx)
          </me>
          Then I replace all the pieces, including changing the
          bounds. 
          <me>
            = \int_4^5 u^3 du 
          </me>
          Then I can proceed to finish the integral. Since this is a
          definite integral and I have changed the bounds as well, I
          do not need to reverse the substitution. 
          <me>
            = \frac{u^4}{4} \Big|_4^5 = \frac{5^4}{4} - \frac{4^4}{4}
            = \frac{625 - 256}{4} = \frac{369}{4} 
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>

    <activity>
      <statement>

          <me>
            \int_0^4 \frac{x}{x+3} dx 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          I'd like to simplify the denominator, so I'll try a
          substitution with <m>u = (x+3)</m>. Since this is a definite
          integral, I'll change the bounds as well. Finally, I'll need
          to replace the numerator in the substitution, so I'll figure
          out how to express the numerator in the new variable. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              u \amp = x+3
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              du \amp = dx 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              x \amp = 0 \implies u = 0 + 3 = 3 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              x \amp = 4 \implies u = 4 + 3 = 7 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              u \amp = x + 3 \implies x = u - 3 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Now I have all the pieces and I can change to the new
          variable, including changing the bounds. 
          <me>
            \int_0^4 \frac{x}{x+3} dx = \int_3^7 \frac{u-3}{u} du 
          </me>
          Then I can split up the integral using linearity into two
          integrals that I can solve with known antiderivatives. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \int_3^7 \frac{u}{u} du - 3 \int_3^7 \frac{1}{u} du

            <mrow>
              \amp = \int_3^7 1 du - 3 \int_3^7 \frac{1}{u} du

              \amp = u \Big|_3^7 - 3 \ln |u| \Big|_3^7 = (7-3) - 3 (\ln 7 -

        <p>
          This look very similar to the previous question. One might
          thing that the process should be exactly the same. You could
          follow that process and get an answer, but that answer would
          not be valid. The problem, here, is that this is a definite
          integral, which calculates an area under the curve. Given
          these bounds, I am looking for the area between 0 and 4.
          However, this function is undefined at <m>x=3</m>, where it
          has a vertical asymptote. Therefore, the notion of area
          under this curve is meaningless. There is no connected curve
          under which I can define an area. This integral has no
          answer.

        <p>
          Now I can move the second term on the right to the left.
          Since is it exactly the same integral, when I add it to the
          left, I get two of them. Then I just divide by <m>2</m> for
          the final solution.

        <p>
          I choose <m>\frac{df}{dx} = \sqrt{x+6}</m>
          and <m>g = x</m>. Seeing the derivative of <m>g</m> is
          relativel easy: <m>\frac{dg}{dx} = 1</m>. However, the
          antiderivative of <m>\frac{df}{dx}</m> requires more work.
          Let me actually do this integral.

          After undoing the substitution, I see the antiderivative is

          I need to do integration by parts again. 
          I choose <m>\frac{df}{dx} = (x+2)^{\frac{4}{3}}</m>
          and <m>g = x</m>.  The antiderivative is <m>f =
          \frac{3}{7} (x+2)^{\frac{7}{3}}</m>, again found by
          substitution and the inverse power rule. 
          The derivative is<m>\frac{dg}{dx} = 1</m>. Then I apply
          integration by parts a second time. Again, since this is a
          definite integral, I apply the bounds to the non-integral
          term. The final integral that results is an inverse power
          rule integral. After evaluating the pieces on the bounds as
          I go along, I get a lot of pretty annoying arithmetic. I've
          tried to simplify it as best I can while still keeping it in
          exact values.
