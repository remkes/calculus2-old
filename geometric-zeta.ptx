  <title>Geometric and <m>\zeta</m> Series</title>
  <p>
    There are two important classes of convergent series which we will use throughout this chapter.
    The first is the geometric series.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For <m>|r|\lt 0</m>,
        the geometric series with common ratio <m>r</m> is this series.
        <me>
          \sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The geometric series with common ratio <m>r</m> converges to
        <m>\frac{1}{1-r}</m> as long as <m>|r|\lt 1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      For <m>|r| \lt  1</m>, we look at the partial sums.
      We multiply by <m>\frac{1-r}{1-r}</m>.
      In the expansion in the denominator,
      most of the terms cancel and we are left with a simple expression.
      <me>
        s_k = 1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + \ldots + r^k = \frac{1-r}{1-r} \left( 1 + r + r^3 + r^3 + \ldots + r^k \right) = \frac{(1-r^k)}{1-r}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The convergence of the series is shown by the limit of these partial sums.
      <me>
        \sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1-r^k}{1-r} = \frac{1}{1-r}
      </me>
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    The second class of convergent series are the <m>\zeta</m> (zeta) series.
    These are often called <m>p</m>-series in standard texts.
    We are calling them <m>\zeta</m> series since this definition,
    in a broader context, gives the famous Riemann <m>\zeta</m> function.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <m>\zeta</m> series is the infinite series with terms <m>\frac{1}{n^p}</m>.
        <me>
          \zeta(p) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^p}
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <m>\zeta</m> series converges when <m>p > 1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <p>
    We give this without proof for now.
    The convergence of the <m>\zeta</m> series can be proved with the Integral Test in <xref ref="integral-test">Section</xref>.
    Unlike the geometric series, where we can easily write the value,
    the actual value of <m>\zeta(p)</m> is not easy to express in conventional algebraic terms.
