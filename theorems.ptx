    <title>Formalizing Calculus</title>
    <p>
      In this section, I'd like to simply list several useful theorems
      that relate to limits, continuity and derivatives. If this were
      a more formal course, a majority of our time might be spent on
      similar theorems and their implications. For our purposes,
      though, you should know that these theorem exists and you should
      have a reasonable understanding of their interpretation. Theorems
      are also an important aspect of formalization: as mathematics
      becomes formalized, we insist on theorems and proofs to build up
      the formal structure.

    <title>The Intermediate Value Theorem</title>
    <p>
      First, let's review continuity. There are several ways to
      define continuity; I prefer this definition: A function <m>f</m>
      is continuous at a point <m>a</m> if <m>a</m> is in the domain
      of <m>f</m> and 
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = f(a)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a continuous function, the limit is just the function value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first theorem is the Intermediate Value Theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f(x)</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and if <m>f(a)
          \lt c \lt f(b)</m> or <m>f(b)\lt c \lt f(a)</m>, then there
          exists <m>x_0\in (a,b)</m> such that <m>f(x_0) = c</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This is stated formally, but the idea is relatively
      understandable. This theorem simply says that a continuous
      function must go through all its intermediate values. If
      <m>f(0) = 0</m> and <m>f(1) = 4</m>, then all numbers between
      <m>0</m> and <m>4</m> are intermediate values. The theorem says
      that somewhere in the interval <m>(0,1)</m>, the function takes
      all these intermediate values at least once. It can't skip or
      jump: it can't go from 0 to 4 without also going throuth <m>1,
      2, 3, \frac{3}{2}, \sqrt{2}, \pi</m>, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      A common application of the IVT is looking for roots of
      difficult functions.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the quintic <m>f(x) = x^5 - x^4 + 2x^3 - 2x^2 + 2x
          - 1</m>. Since this is a quintic, there is no formula like
          the quadratic formula to find the roots (the insolvability
          of the quintic by a formula is, in itself, a very
          interesting piece of mathematics). Using the IVT, if we can
          find a value where the function is positive and another
          where the function is negative, we can look for a root
          between those values. In the following list, each pair of
          successive function values has one positive and one
          negative. The IVT says that a root must lie between these
          values. For convenience of notation, let <m>a</m> be the
          desired root.

    <title>Rolle's Theorem and Mean Value Theorem</title>
    <p>
      We move on to theorems related to differentiation. The first is
      Rolle's Theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m>, continuously
          differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m> (note the difference in
          intervals) and if <m>f(a) = f(b)</m>, then there exists <m>c
          \in (a,b)</m> such that <m>f^\prime(c) = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Interpreted as movement in one dimension, Rolle's theorem says
      that if we get back to where we started, we must turn around.
      Getting back to where we started is <m>f(a) = f(b)</m>. Turning
      around is having a point where there is zero rate of change,
      where our velocity changes from going out to going back in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very similar to Rolle's theorem is the Mean Value Theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m>, continuously
          differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>, then there exists a value
          <m>c \in (a,b)</m> such that
          <me>
            f^\prime(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Interpreted as movement in one dimension, the MVT says that at
      some point in time, we realize our average rate of change. The
      term on the right is the average rate of change and the theorem
      says that there is a point <m>c</m> where the derivative, the
      actual rate of change, is equal to this average change. At
      other points in time, we might be moving slower or faster, but
      somewhere we achieve the average speed at least once.
