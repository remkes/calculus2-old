    <title>Constructing Numbers</title>
    <p>
      The historical problem of formalizing the limit is deeply
      connected with the problem of the continuum. There are many
      historical forms and presentations of the problem of the
      continuum, but here is a common version: how can an infinitely
      divisible number line exist and how can we be sure it doesn't
      have any holes? The continuum is the name of this infinitely
      divisible and gap-less number line, so the problem is
      essentially a problem of giving a good, formal construction of
      the continuum. In modern mathematics, this is done by
      constructing the real numbers <m>\RR</m>, and proving that they
      are ordered in such a way as to form this infinitely divisible,
      gap-less continuum, which we call the real number line.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we'll review the idea of constructing number
      sets, starting with <m>\NN</m> and working up to <m>\RR</m>.
      This is a formalizing process: intuitively, we have ideas of
      natural numbers, integers, rational numbers and real numbers.
      However, mathematics isn't content with these intuitive ideas.
      It wants clear, formal definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll start with the assumption that the natural numbers are
      given. (The construction of the natural numbers out of set
      theory is a fascinating piece of mathematics, but it takes a lot
      of time so we will unfortunatley have to skip it).

      The construction of <m>\ZZ</m> from <m>\NN</m> is relatively
      easy: it is essentially equivalent to the childhood realization
      that negative numbers exists and have meaning. Formally, the
      construction is stated in this definition.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\ZZ</m> is defined by adding, for every <m>n \in \NN</m>
          except <m>0</m>, a the new symbol <m>-n</m> with the
          following properties.
          <md>
            <mrow>n + (-n) \amp = 0</mrow>
            <mrow>-(n + m) \amp = -n + -m</mrow>
            <mrow>-(nm) \amp = (-n)m = n(-m)</mrow>
            <mrow>(-n)(-m) \amp = nm</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      These properties are sufficient to give the entire structure of
      the integers, fitting them into the existing addition and
      multiplication of the natural numbers. They also define
      subtraction, by saying that <m>n-m</m> is defined to be <m>n +
      (-m)</m>.

    <title>The Rational Numbers</title>
    <p>
      The construction of <m>\QQ</m> from <m>\ZZ</m> is also
      relatively easy and proceeds in a very similar way. As with
      <m>\ZZ</m>, where we defined new symbols <m>-n</m> and put them
      into our arithmetic system, here we also define new symbols and
      give rules to tell how the symbols fit into the existing
      arithmetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the set of symbol <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> where <m>a, b \in
      \ZZ</m> and <m>b \neq 0</m>, with the following properties.
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{a}{a} \amp = 1</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} \amp = \frac{ad + bc}{bd}</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{a}{b} \frac{c}{d} \amp = \frac{ac}{bd}</mrow>
        <mrow>-\frac{a}{b} \amp = \frac{-a}{b} = \frac{a}{-b}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      These operations give us the well-defined structure of the
      rational numbers, with multiplication, addition and subtraction.
      They let us define division of integers by simply writing the
      fraction <m>\frac{a}{b}</m>. We can then define division of
      rationals (assuming <m>c \neq 0</m>) by
      <me>
        \frac{\frac{a}{b}}{\frac{c}{d}} = \frac{ad}{bc}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there is one new subtlety involved in <m>\QQ</m>. Unlike
      the unique symbols for integers (<m>-3</m> can only be written
      as <m>-3</m>), we know that both <m>\frac{2}{5}</m> and
      <m>\frac{4}{10}</m> represent the same number. In addition to
      the rules of arthimetic of these new fraction-symbols, we also
      need a rule which identifies redundant symbols. The rule is this:
      <me>
        \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \iff ad = bc
      </me>.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\QQ</m> is defined to be the fraction-symbols with the
          above arithmetic, up to identification of equivalent
          fractions.
        </p>

    <title>The Real Numbers</title>
    <p>
      In the search for the continuum, the rational numbers are
      already close. They have the infinitly divisible property we
      want: between any two rational numbers we can construct a new
      rational number, simply take the sum of the two numbers divided
      by 2. However, they lack the gap-less nature of the continuum.
      This is a very old problem: the Pythagoreans had trouble with
      the idea that <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, which is a real, measurable
      length, wasn't represented by a fraction. <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is an
      example of a gap in the rational numbers. The real numbers are
      constructed to extend <m>\QQ</m> by filling in the gaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of ways to do this. Intuitively, we've
      treated real numbers as all decimal expansions. This is a
      reasonable definition, but it implicitly relies on more advanced
      results about the convergence of infinite series. The trouble
      with these decimals is that they are infinite: unlike the
      <m>-n</m> symbols that defined <m>\ZZ</m> or the
      <m>\frac{a}{b}</m> symbols that defined <m>\QQ</m>, we can't
      actually write down the symbols that define <m>\RR</m>, since
      they are potentially non-repeating infinite strings of digits.
      This is quite unsatisfying. (Unfortunately, we will eventually
      discover that there isn't really any way to write the elements
      of <m>\RR</m> in any concise way.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm going to present two ideas which were used historically to
      define <m>\RR</m>. The first is quite abstract, but beautiful
      in its approach; the second is a little bit more useful.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-dedekind-cuts">
    <title>Dedekind Cuts</title>
    <p>
      The first approach is due to the 19th century mathematician
      Dedekind and is called the method of Dedekind cuts. The idea is
      beautifully simple: the problem with <m>\QQ</m> is that it has
      gaps. Why not define <m>\RR</m> to be exactly those gaps?
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>Dedekind cut</term> is a seperation of <m>\QQ</m>
          into two pieces, determined by order: one half of <m>\QQ</m>
          is all numbers less than (or equal) something, and one half
          of <m>\QQ</m> is all numbers greater than (or equal)
          something. The <term>real numbers</term> can be defined as
          the set of all possible Dedekind cuts.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      First, all rational numbers provide such a cut. If I take
      <m>\frac{3}{2}</m>, I can cut <m>\QQ</m> into all pieces <m>\lt
      \frac{3}{2}</m> and all pieces <m>\geq \frac{3}{2}</m>. Notice
      that by starting with a rational number, I have a strict
      endpoint to one of my pieces: the upper piece has
      <m>\frac{3}{2}</m> as its lowest element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, any gap in <m>\QQ</m> is a Dedekind cut. Take
      <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, for instance. I can split <m>\QQ</m> into
      those numbers which are <m>\lt \sqrt{2}</m> and those <m>>
      \sqrt{2}</m>. As such, <m>\sqrt{2}</m> defines a Dedekind cut,
      hence a real number in this construction. Notice there that
      neither piece has a lowest element in <m>\QQ</m>: the new
      <sq>numbers</sq> are the cuts for which neither piece has a
      lowest or highest element.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I said, this is a very abstract presentation of <m>\RR</m>.
      It is stange and difficult to work with. We could go on to
      define arithmetic on cuts, but it's a laborious and tricky
      project. I'm including Dedekind cuts for their extreme
      elegance and style: gaps are the problems, so lets define the
      solution to be exactly those gaps!
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-rational-sequences">
    <title>Limits of Rational Sequences</title>
    <p>
      The second approach is also due to a 19th century mathematician,
      this time Cauchy. It relates to limits and our formalization
      of them. (Cauchy was heavily involved and influential in the
      19th century formalization of calculus and limits).
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>\RR</m> is the set of all possible limits of convergent
          sequences of rational numbers, with a reasonable way of
          identifying equal limits.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We're not going to deal this construction in detail, though
      later in the course, we will talk about sequences and
      convergence. In particular, we'll show that all decimals
      expantions are sequences of rational numbers; in this sense,
      decimal expansions are a convenient notational tool for Cauchy's
      definition. In brief, we can easily see how a decimal
      expansions is, implicitly, an infinite sum. For example:
      <me>
        4.0983243\ldots = 4 + \frac{0}{10} + \frac{9}{100} +
        \frac{8}{1000} + \frac{3}{10^4} + \frac{2}{10^5} +
        \frac{4}{10^6} + \frac{3}{10^7} + \ldots 
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      For our current purposes, we'll leave aside the further
      formalization of the construction of <m>\RR</m> and make use of
      the intuitive idea of decimal expansions. What is important is
      that we have constructed the continuum: <m>\RR</m> is infinitely
      divisible and has no gaps.
