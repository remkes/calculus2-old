    <title>Definitions and Reaction Rates</title>
    <p>
      In applied mathematics, we often have a number of different
      quantities that all depend on a common independent variable.
      A mathematical model often describes the relationship between the
      various quantities. In addition, all these quantities typically
      have derivatives with respect to the common variable.

          A related rates is a relationship between the derivatives of
          two or more function (with respect to a common independent
          variable).

          An easy first example is reaction rates in Chemistry. Let's
          take a very simple reaction: the product of <m>NaCl</m> salt
          from free <m>Na^+</m> and <m>Cl^-</m> ions. We write this
          reaction as:
          <me>
            Na^+ + Cl^- \rightarrow NaCl
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>N</m>, <m>C</m> and <m>S</m> (for salt) represent the
          molar quantity of the ions or salts and assume that all
          three are functions of time. The total amount of material,
          either sodium or chlorine, is preserved in time.
          Mathematically, this is <m>N + S = c_1</m> or <m>C + S =
          c_2</m> for some constants <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>. We
          can differentiate both equations.
          <me>
            \frac{dN}{dt} = - \frac{dS}{dt} \hspace{1cm} \text{ and }
            \hspace{1cm} \frac{dC}{dt} = - \frac{dS}{dt}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is what we call a related rate. We have an
          original equation between some quantities which all depend
          on a common independent variable (here time). We
          differentiate in that variable, to get an equation between
          the various derivatives. That new equation is a relation
          between the rates of change. In this case, the related rate
          equation states the very obvious observation that the
          decrease in <m>Na^+</m> or <m>Cl^-</m> ions happens as the
          same rate as the production of <m>NaCl</m>. We really
          didn't need the heavy machinery of derivatives to understand
          this; we could have seen it from the reaction setup. But
          this serves as a simple example to explain the idea of
          related rates.

      To summarize, this is the general procedure for related reates:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Write the relationship between two or more quantities.
            (If necessary, use geometry or other information to reduce
            to two quantities if more are initially involved.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Realize that all quantities depend on a common variable,
            usually time.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Differentiate (implicitly) with respect to the common
            variable.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Solve for the desired rate and see the relationship.

        <p>
          A classic example seen in almost all calculus texts is the
          the falling ladder problem shown in <xref
          ref="figure-falling-ladder">Figure</xref>. A ladder of
          length <m>l</m> leans against a wall, where <m>a</m> is the
          height along the wall and <m>b</m> is the length from the
          base of the wall to the base of the ladder. The ladder is
          sliding down the wall such that it always remains in contact
          with both the wall and the ground. What is the relationship
          between the change in <m>a</m> and the change in <m>b</m>?
        </p>
        <p>
          As with most related rates problems, we often have to do
          some interpretation or setup to get the equations. The
          quantities we care about are the lengths <m>a</m> and
          <m>b</m>. (<m>l</m>, the length of the ladder, is fixed.)
          The geometry here is a right triangle, so <m>l^2 = a^2 +
          b^2</m>. Since <m>l</m> is constant, this is the
          relationship we need between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. We
          differentiate with respect to time.
          <me>
            0 = 2a \frac{da}{dt} + 2b \frac{db}{dt} \implies
            \frac{da}{dt} = -\frac{b}{a} \frac{db}{dt}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that this depends on <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. For
          different values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, we have different
          relationships, which is typical for related rates. The
          original quantities are part of the equation as well as
          their derivatives. To get a specific answer, we have to
          input some of these values. For example, if the length of
          the ladder is <m>\sqrt{74}</m> meters and <m>a=7</m> with
          <m>b=5</m> then when <m>\frac{db}{dt} = 3 m/s</m> we
          calculate
          <me>
            \implies \frac{da}{dt} = -\frac{b}{a} \frac{db}{dt} =
            \frac{-5}{7} 3 = \frac{-15}{7} m/s
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we fed in different values for <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> or
          <m>\frac{db}{dt}</m> we would have a different
          relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also notice that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have to be chosen to
          match the original geometry. We can take <m>a=7</m> and
          <m>b=5</m>, or <m>a = \sqrt{34}</m> and <m>b =
          \sqrt{40}</m>, because both give the corred ladder length in
          <m>a^2 + b^2 = l^2</m>. However, we can't take <m>a = 2</m>
          and <m>b=3</m>, since they don't satisfy the original
          geometry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, notice that one derivative is positive while one
          the other is negative. This reflects the geometry of the
          situation; as with all of applied mathematics, we should
          always relate our answer back to the situation and test its
          reasonability.

          Another classic example is the melting snowball. Assume
          there is a perfectly spherical snowball with radius
          <m>r</m>, volume <m>V</m> and surface area <m>A</m>. Assume
          also that this snowball amazingly melts in such a way that
          it stays perfectly spherical. What is the relationship
          between <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m>, <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m> and
          <m>\frac{dA}{dt}</m> as the snowball melts? Here are the
          relevant geometric equations.

            <mrow>
              V \amp = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3

            </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we assume that all these quantities depend on time and
          we differentiate.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \frac{dV}{dt} \amp = 4\pi r^2 \frac{dr}{dt}

        </p>
        <p>
          If we want, we can also rearrange and substitute to find the
          related rate equation for <m>V</m> and <m>A</m>.

          Other common examples of related rates involve liquids moving
          between different sizes and shapes of holding tanks. Let's
          consider a conical tank draining into a cubical tank.
          Assume the conical tank has an angle of <m>\pi/4</m> between
          its slant and the vertical, and that it drains out of the
          vertex at the bottom of the cone. Let's say the height of
          the conical tank is 20 meters and it drains into a cubical
          tank of side length 10 meters. The related rates question
          is: given depths of liquid in each tank (<m>h_1</m> and
          <m>h_2</m>, respectively), what the relationship between the
          lowering rate of <m>h_1</m> in the cone and the rising rate
          of <m>h_2</m> in the cube?
        </p>
        <p>
          We need the relationship between the two heights. The
          important observation is that the sum of volume of the the
          water cone <m>V_1</m> and the volume in the cube <m>V_2</m>
          is constant. That is <m>V_1 + V_2 = c</m>. Then we can
          relate the volumes to the heights.
          <me>
            V_1 = \frac{1}{3} \pi h_1^3 \hspace{1cm} \text{ and }
            \hspace{1cm} V_2 = 100 h_2
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          That gives this relationship between the heights.
          <me>
            \frac{1}{3} \pi h_1^3 + 100 h_2 = c
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          We differentiate this relationship.

          For our last example, we can look at gas laws. The ideal
          gas law is <m>PV = nRT</m> where <m>P</m> is pressure,
          <m>V</m> is volume, <m>n</m> is the (constant) molar
          quantity of the gas, <m>R</m> is a constant and <m>T</m> is
          temperature, which we also assume is constant. First, let's
          solve for <m>P</m> and differentiate with respect to time
          <m>t</m>.
          <me>
            P = \frac{nRT}{V} \implies \frac{dP}{dt} =
            \frac{-nRT}{V^2} \frac{dV}{dt}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Likewise, we can solve for <m>V</m> and differentiate with
          respect to time.
          <me>
            V = \frac{nRT}{P} \implies \frac{dV}{dt} =
            \frac{-nRT}{P^2} \frac{dP}{dt} \implies \frac{dP}{dt} =
