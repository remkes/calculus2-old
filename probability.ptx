    <title>Probability Density Functions</title>
    <p>
      I've done two weeks so far with applications of integration:
      parametric curves and volumes. The last week of these
      applications is using integration for probability. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The study of probablity can be roughly broken up into two kinds
      of data: discrete and continuous.  In discrete data, there are a
      finite number of seperate possible measurements, each of which
      has a finite probability. The study of discrete probability can
      be entirely accomplished with finite sums (though even there,
      caluculus can give surprising insights.) Exam marks are a
      typical discrete measurement: there are only a finite number of
      possibilities. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuous probability involves measurements which can vary
      anywhere within a range.  Heights in a population are a typical
      continuous measurement: assuming sufficient precision, a height
      can be any real number in a particular range. At least
      mathematically, there are infinitely many possible measurements.
      As opposed to discrete probability, I can't assign a specific
      likeliness to any particular measurement in a continuous
      situation. Instead, I can assign a probability to a range of
      measurements. For example: there is a 20% change that an adult
      female caribou stands more than 125 cm tall at the shoulder. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The main application of integration to probability is to
      understand continuous data. To that end, let me make the key
      definition. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>probability density function</term> or
          <term>probability distribution</term>  is an 
          integrable function <m>f(x) : [a,b] \rightarrow [0,
          \infty)</m> such that
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_a^b f(x) dx = 1
        </me>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      A probability distribution is a very new kind of thing, so let me
      make some important notes about its properties and
      interpretation. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          First and most counter-intuitive: the quantity that is being
          measure is the <em>input</em> of the probability. When
          talking about, say, height, it is familiary for height to be
          the dependent variable. Height depends on time, or position,
          or something else. For probabilities of heights, height is
          the independent variable. The function <m>f(x)</m> is asking
          about the probability of the measurement <m>x</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The output <m>f(x)</m> is vague a measure of how likely the
          measurement <m>x</m> is, but only vaguely. For continuous
          probability, since infinitely many measurements are possible
          in a range, each individual precise measurement actually has
          zero probability. Instead, a probability is only given for a
          range of measurement. For continuous probability, I can
          never ask: how likely is a height of 6 meters? Instead, I
          can only ask: how likely is a height between 5 and 6 meters. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The probability distribution is positive. A negative probabity
          has no meaning. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The interval <m>[a,b]</m> is the range of all possible
          measurements. The integral condition in the definition is
          simply saying that all measurements fall in this range (with
          probability 1). Then, if <m>x_0</m> and <m>x_1</m> are in
          the interval <m>[a,b]</m> (and <m>x_0 \lt x_1</m>), the
          probability of a measurement between <m>x_0</m> and
          <m>x_1</m> is given by the integral of the probability
          distribution.
        </p>
        <me>
         P([x_0,x_1])  = \int_{x_0}^{x_1} f(x) dx
        </me>
        <p>
          This notation, where <m>P([a,b]</m> is the probability of a
          measurement in the range <m>[a,b]</m>, is conventional. I'll
          use this notation throughout this section. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          This probability <m>P</m> of a measurement in some range
          will have <m>0 \leq P \leq 1</m>, depending on the endpoint
          and the particular nature of the distribution.
          Continuous probabilities are not given in percentages;
          instead, they are given in fractions. If the integral
          produces the valyue <m>P = \frac{1}{2}</m>, that's
          equivalent to the colloquial <m>50\%</m> probability.
          Percentage language is quite common in discrete probability,
          but much less common in continuous probability. I won't use
          percentage langauge at all in this course. Instead, a
          probability of <m>1</m> is an even that is sure to happen,
          and all other probability will be decimals or fractions
          between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Even though the integral is bounded above by <m>1</m>,
          the probability distribution itself is not bounded by <m>1</m>.
          It can take arbitrarily large values, as long as the spike
          is narrow enough such that the area under the curve remains
          <m>1</m> over the whole interval. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Both the terms, probability density funciton and probability
          distribution, are conventional. I'll mostly use
          distribution. Technically, a distribution is an extension of
          the notion of a function; there are distributions which are
          not actually functions. However, that subtlety isn't
          important for the examples in this course, so I'll just keep
          using distribution to refer to the functions that measure
          probabilility.

          I've verified that this is, indeed, a probability
          distribution on <m>[0,\infty)</m>. It is called the
          <term>exponential distribution</term>. The fact that
          <m>f</m> is a decay function means that measurements gets
          less and less likely as values get large. It is common to
          get measurements close to zero and uncommon to get large
          measurements. The decay coefficient <m>\alpha</m> controls
          this effect: for large <m>\alpha</m>, the decay is faster
          and measurements near zero are even more common.

          The most well-known probability distribution is the bell
          curve, which is also called the gaussian distribution or
          normal distribution. In full generality it depends on two
          parameters <m>\mu</m> and <m>\sigma</m> and has the
          following form.
        </p>
        <me>
          f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}
          e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
        </me>
        <p>
          The constant <m>\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}</m> ensures that
          the integra over all of <m>\RR</m> is <m>1</m>, as required
          for the definition. (Again, this is called the normalization
          constant). <m>\mu</m> is the centre point of the bell curve,
          and <m>\sigma</m> measure the width of the bell curve (in a
          way that will be formalized below). For a specific example,
          I can take <m>\mu = 0</m> and <m>\sigma =
          \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}</m> to get a bell curve centred at
          <m>0</m>. This specific bell curve is shown in <xref
          ref="figure-gaussian-distribution" />.

        </me>
        <p>
          The fact that this function has the correct integral value
          for the definition is actually very difficult to establish.
          Specifically, look at this integral.

          The function <m>e^{-x^2}</m> has no elementary
          antiderivative. Given the important of the gaussian
          distribution, this may be the most notable function without
          an elementary antiderivative. Actually proving this integral
          requires techniques well beyond this course.

          In probability theory, it is often important to have these

          and properties of the uinform distribution, where
          all measurements (in a range) are equally likely, leads to a
          better understanding of more complicated distributions by

    <title>Means</title>
    <p>
      For discrete probability, a mean or average of the expected
      measurements is relatively intuitive: I just add up the
      measurements multiplied by their probabilities. What a mean
      should be for a continuous probability isn't as immediately
      obvious, since I can't add up the infinitely-many measurements.
      However, I can still take inspiration from the discrete case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me consider finite probability for a moment. Say that there
      are <m>n</m> events with probabilities <m>p_i</m> and
      measurements <m>m_i</m>. In order to ensure this is a valid
      probability situation, the sume of all the probabilities must be
      <m>1</m>. 
    </p>
    <me>
      \sum_{i=1}^n p_i = 1
    </me>.
    <p>
      The mean is the sum of the measurements multiplied by their
      probabilities.
    </p>
    <me>
      \sum_{i=1}^n m_i p_i
    </me>
    <p>
      These discrete calculations give inspiration for the continuous
      case. The major difference, for continuous probability, is that
      the sums are now integrals. Changing the sums to integrals, the
      steps are essentially the sum: the sum of the probabilities
      because the integral of the probabilitiy density function.
      Multipyling by the actually measurement in the sum is equivalent
      to multiplying by the independent variable, since the
      independent variable is the measurement. This leads to a
      definition.

          This mean makes some sense for a decay function. Even
          though very large measurements are possible, they become

          There are two integral to do here. Let me deal with the
          first integral first.  Even though <m>e^{-x^2}</m> has no
          antiderivative, now I have something similar to
          <m>xe^{-x^2}</m> which does have an elementary
          antiderivative found by substitution. I could do that
          substitution and sovle this integral that way, but there is
          an easier method. The function
          <m>ve^{-\frac{v^2}{2\sigma^2}}</m> is an odd function: it's
          positive part if a mirror of its negative part, but changes
          from below the axis to above the axis. Therefore, there is
          an equal area under the curve for the positive and negative
          pieces, but with different signs. In the limit for the
          improper integrals, these two areas will perfectly cancel
          each other out. This first integral must be zero.

          Unsurprisingly, given the choice of notation, the parameter
          <m>\mu</m> (which is the centre point of the bell curve) is
          the mean of the distribution. The guassian distribution is
          the first and most important symmetry distribution: there is
          a mean at the centre of the distribution and the probability
          decays away from the mean equally on both sides. This means
          that measurements in symmetric ranges above and below the
          mean are equally likely.

    <title>Central Tendencies</title>
    <p>
      The mean or average is only one of several possible measures of
      what is the most likely outcome of a measurement. In general, a
      <em>central tendency</em> is any mathematical calculation of a
      <sq>typical</sq> value; for most distributions, there are
      several different central tendencies which I can consider. It
      isn't always obvious which is the most appropriate. The three
      most common and most well-known central tendencies are mean
      (average), median and mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      An important examples of the use of these central tendencies is
      in statistical data like income and wealth. The distributions
      for income and wealth are similar to the exponential
      distribution: most measurements are near the minimum, but there
      are a small num er of measurements that are very, very high. In
      these distributions, different central tendencies gives
      significantly different result. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, look at the income data for Canada. (Rough figure
      here are taken from the Stats Canada website in March, 2021).
      The mean/average income in 2018 for Canadian 16 and over was
      <m>\$48,000</m>. However, the mediam income was <m>\$36,400</m>.
      That's a pretty substantial difference. Which of these measure
      the <sq>typical</sq> Canadian?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to say which central tendency is more
      appropriate. In particular, the judgement of which central
      tendency to use is external to 
      mathematics. Mathematics doesn't give moral guidance for
      which type of central tendency is the best <emdash/> it just
      tells you how to calculate each type. For data like income,
      which has a very long tail on the positive side of its
      distribution, typical practice is to record median instead of
      average. The community has judged it to be a more reasonable
      measure. But, again, the point here is that such a judgement
      happens outside of the mathematics. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      Let me actually now define median for continuous probability. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For continuous probability and probability density
          <m>f(x)</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>, the median is defined to be the
          unique number <m>c</m> such that the following equation
          holds. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_a^c f(x) dx = \int_c^b f(x) dx = \frac{1}{2}
        </me>
        <p>
          Since integrals are areas under the curve, and the total
          area on <m>[a,b]</m> is <m>1</m>, the median is the place
          which exactly divdes the area under the curve into halves.

          The median of this distribution is <m>\ln 2</m>, which is
          smaller than the mean of <m>1</m>. As mentioned above for
          income data, this difference between mean and median is
          typical for distributions with a long tail on one side. The
          very high values pull up the mean, but not the median.

      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      One of the reasons that the bell curve is very commonly used to
      understand probability is that it is very well behaved for
      central tendencies. Basically any central tendency you can
      calculate for a bell-curve will give <m>\mu</m>, the mean.

      The mean measure, in some sense, the most likely measurement.
      (This is never precisely true for continuous probability, since
      there are infinitely many possible measurements). It answer the
      question: what do I expect the measurement to be? I expect the
      measurement to be the mean or at least something close to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This leads to new terminology. The mean is often called the
      <term>expectation value</term> of the measurement. This also has
      some new notation.  If <m>f(x)</m> on <m>[a,b]</m> is a
      probability distribution, the mean or expectation value is
      written <m>\left\langle x\right\rangle</m>.
    </p>

      It is also possible to have some other quantity which depends on
      the measurement. I can think of some function <m>g(x)</m> which
      has the same independent variable as the probability
      distribution (because, again, the independent variable is the
      measurement). These related functions of the measurements also
      have expectation values and these expectations values are also
      calculated by integrals of the probability distribution.

          likely outcome of <m>g(x)</m> is called the expectation
          value of <m>g(x)</m> and is calculated by the following integral.

      Modern quantum mechanics is all based on probability.
      Measurables such as position, velocity, momentum and energy are
      all functions on the probability space. The actual values
      referened to are not strict values, but expectation values. The
      previous definitin of expectation value calculates all these
      measurables. Once this interpretation is in place, the physics
      of the situation is understood by knowing the time development
      of the probability distribution (strictly speaking, of the
      a closely related function called the wave function in
      quantum mechanics).  Schrodinger's equation, the heart of
      quantum mechanics, is precisely the differential equation that
      describes the time development of the probability distribution.
      The only sense of measurement is expectation value.

    <title>Standard Deviation</title>
    <p>
      One I've chosen a central tendency, such as the mean, I can ask
      about the variance of the distribution. The variance is the
      spread of the distribution: how far away measurements are from
      the mean.  Am I likely to get measurements very near the mean,
      or very far away? The <em>standard deviation</em> of a
      probability distribution is the first tool to measure variance.
      A low standard deviation means that most measurements are close
      to the mean, and a high standard deviation means that
      measurements can be very spread-out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the bell curve, I will write <m>\mu</m> for the mean of
      a probability distribution <m>f(x)</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>. The
      distance of a measurement from the mean is given by
      <m>|x-\mu|</m>. I could ask for the expectation value of this
      distance, which would be a measure of variance. However, the
      convention is to isntead ask for the expectation value of the
      square of this distance.

      This integral calculate <m>\sigma^2</m>. The squares of
      <m>(x-\mu)</m> inside the integral can be though of as a
      pythagorena sum. In discrete probability, this would exactly be
      the case: the square of the standard deviation is the sum of the
      squares or the variance of each measurement. In continuous
      probability, this sum becomes an integral. This pythagorean
      combination is a reasonable way of adding up the individual
      variances to produce the standard deviation if I think of each
      measurement as being something independent, like independent
      directions. Let me proceed to calculate some examples.
