  <title>Long Division and Factoring</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Now I want to start the steps of turning an arbitrary rational
      function <m>f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}</m> into a sum of integral
      of the three types introduced in <xref
      ref="section-rational-functions-basic" />. There are three
      steps; two of this are covered in this section before I move on
      to the major new step in <xref ref="section-pf" />. In this
      section, I want to talk about polynomial division and polynomial
      factoring.

    <title>Long Division</title>
    <p>
      I need to start with a definition. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>proper</term> rational function is one where the
          degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the
          denmoninator.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      I want to change an arbitrary rational function into a proper
      rational function. To do this with fractions, say turning
      <m>\frac{17}{5}</m> into <m> 5 + \frac{2}{5}</m>, the old
      technique was long division with remainer. The same is true for
      polynomials. To reduce a rational function to a proper ration
      function, I'm going to do long division with remaind. (I'll
      present the long division algorithm, but the synthetic division
      algorithm also nicely extends to polynomial.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In long division of numbers, each step focused on a place value
      (thousands, hundreas, tens, etc.). For polynomials, the steps
      will proceed by the degree of the polynomial (<m>x^4</m> then
      <m>x^3</m> then <m>x^2</m>, etc). The technique is best shown by
      example.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider this rational fucntion.
        </p>
        <me>
          \frac{x^4+3x^2+2x+4}{x^2+4} 
        </me>
        <p>
          This rational function is not proper. The degree of the
          numerator is <m>4</m> and the degree of the denomintor is
          <m>2</m>. I am going to do long division to make this a proper
          function. I divide <m> x^4+3x^2+2x+4</m> by <m>x^2+4</m>,
          working degree by degree and using the conventional algorithm.
          Looking at the first degrees, I ask how can <m>x^2</m> divide
          <m>x^4</m>? I need to multiply by <m>x^2</m>, so that is the
          first term of the quotient. Then I multiply <m>x^2</m> by
          <m>x^2 + 4</m>, subtract from <m>x^4 + 3x^2 + 2x + 4</m>, and
          continue the algorithm. I stop when the remaining term has
          degree less than two, since the denominator has degree two.

          The quotient, <m>x^2 - 1</m> stands along. The remainder
          becomes the new numerator. The result of the long division
          is this equation.

          This is now the sum of a polynomial (which is easy to deal

    <title>Factoring Polynomials</title>
    <p>
      Long division was the first step. Now I will assume that all the
      rational function I am dealing with will be proper. The next
      steps is factoring. More specifically, for the technique I am
      going to introduce in <xref ref="section-pf" />, I will need the
      denominators to be factored as much as possible. Factoring
      polynomials is somewhat familiar, particularly for quadratics,
      but I wanted to review the general theory before moving on. Let
      me start with some definition. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A polynomial factor of the form <m>(x-\alpha)</m> is called a
          <term>linear factor</term>. Having a linear factor
          <m>(x-\alpha)</m> is equivalent to saying that <m>\alpha</m>
          is a root of the polynomial. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The <term>discriminant</term> of a quadratic <m>ax^2 + bx +
          c</m> is the expression <m>b^2 - 4ac</m>. This is the term
          under the square root in the quadratic formula; it
          determines whether or not the polynomial has real roots. A
          quadratic with negative discriminant has no real roots; such
          a polynomial is called <term>irreducible</term>. Since it has no
          real roots, it has no linear factor and cannot be further
          factors; hence irreducible.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      There is a nice theorem which tells us how polynomial over
      <m>\RR^2</m> factor. I present it here without proof. (It is a
      corollary of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra; a theory which
      tells how polynomials factor over <m>\CC</m>.) 
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        Let <m>p(x)</m> be a polynomial with real coefficients. Then
        <m>p(x)</m> completes factors into linear and irreducible
        quadratic term. Equivalently, there are not
        <sq>irreducible</sq> factors of degree three or higher; all
        such factors will always further break down into linear and
        quadratic terms. 
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This simplifies the theorem substantially. Assuming I can deal
      with factored polynomials, I only have to deal with linear and
      irreducible quadratic terms. This fact is central to the theorem
      I am developing. Notice that the three types of integral I did
      in <hrex ref="section-rational-basic" /> only had linear or
      quadratic denominators. I'm going to eventually reduce the
      integral of any rational function into one with only a linear or
      (irreducible) quadratic denominator. The fact that I can do so
      is a direct consequence of this theorem about factoring. I need
      one more definition.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The number of times that a factor (linear or irreducible
          quadratic) shows up in a polynomial is called the
          <term>multiplicity</term> of the factor. For example, consider
          this factored polynomial.
        </p>
        <me>
          p(x) = (x-3)^4(x-5)^2(x^2 + 4x + 1)^7
        </me>
        <p>
          In this polynomial, the linear factor <m>(x-3)</m> has
          multiplicity <m>4</m>; the linear factor <m>(x-5)</m> has
          multiplicity <m>2</m>; and the irreducible quadratic factor
          <m>(x^2 + 4x + 1)^7</m> has multiplicity <m>7</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This is the theory. In practice, the problem of actually finding
      the factors of a polynomial is a very difficult one. The
      quadratic formula nicely solves this problem for quadratic: we
      can determine whether a quadratic factors into two linear terms
      or remain irreducible based on the discriminant. For cubics and
      quartics, there are similar formulae. However, they get unwieldy
      very quickly. The cubic formula is already several lines of
      ordinary text and the quartic formula is several <em>pages</em>
      of ordinary text. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation of finding roots (and hence linear factors) of
      polynomials gets even worse past this point. For polynomials of
      degree five and higher, there is no formula for roots. Moreover,
      it's not that we just don't know the formula: in a major result
      in 19th mathematics (the Able-Ruffini Theorem) that such a
      formula is, in fact, entirely impossible. This theorem is part
      of a beautiful branch of mathemaatics called Galois theory,
      based on the work of Evariste Galois in the early 19th century. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purpose of this course, you need to know the terminology
      I defined above and the factorization theorem. However, this is
      not a course in factoring polynomials. I'm going to avoid all
      the technical challenges of actually finding (or approximating)
      polynomial factors but giving you factored denominators for all
      the integration problems involving rational functions.
