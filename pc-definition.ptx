  <title>Parametric Curves</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We've done a fair bit of work with loci in this course and in
      Calculus I. Earlier in this course we talked about algebraic
      plane curves, which were the loci of polynomial equations in
      <m>\RR^2</m>. This section introduces a new way to think about
      curves: by thinking of movement along the shape. The movement
      happens with respect to a parameter, which we think of as time:
      as time passes, we move along the curve. For loci like
      algebraic plane curves, the entire curve is presented at one, as
      a complete object. For parametric curves, we start at a point
      and move along the curve in time.

    <title>Definition</title>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>t</m> be an indepedent variable (the parameter),
          which we think of as time. A parametric curve in
          <m>\RR^2</m> is a set of two functions <m>x(t)</m> and
          <m>y(t)</m>, which give the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>
          coordinates of the curve at any point <m>t</m> in time. We
          assume that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are continuous, so that
          the curve is a connected curve. Often we want to refer the
          curve with one symbol, which is typically the greek letter
          <m>\gamma</m>.
          <me>
            \gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this is a function of <m>t</m>, we need a domain.
          Typically we will have <m>t \in [a,b]</m> for an interval.

    <title>Examples</title>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the curve <m>\gamma_1(t) = (t,t)</m> for <m>t \in
          [0,5]</m>. This curves gives the line <m>y=x</m>, starting
          at <m>(0,0)</m> and ending at <m>(5,5)</m>. At <m>t=0</m>,
          the curve is at <m>(0,0)</m>, at <m>t=1</m>, it is at
          <m>(1,1)</m>, and so on. All parametric curves are about
          movement: this is not only the line <m>y=x</m>, but also the
          starting point <m>(0,0)</m>, the ending point <m>(5,5)</m>
          and the rate of movement along the line.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the curve <m>\gamma_2(t) = (-t,-t)</m> for <m>t \in
          [-5,0]</m>. This is exactly the same line, since it still
          satisfies <m>y=x</m>. However, now we start at <m>(5,5)</m>
          when <m>t=-5</m>, and we move towards <m>(0,0)</m> when
          <m>t=0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Now consider the curve <m>\gamma_3(t) = (t^2,t^2)</m> for
          <m>t \in [0,\sqrt{5}]</m>. Again, this is the same line
          and, like <m>\gamma_1</m>, it starts at <m>(0,0)</m> and
          ends at <m>(5,5)</m>. However, it travels the distance a
          smaller parameter domain, meaning that it moves faster.
        </p>

    </figure>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A classic example is <m>\gamma(t) = (\cos t, \sin t)</m> for
          <m>t \in [0,2\pi]</m>. This curve is just the unit circle,
          traced counter clockwise, starting at <m>(1,0)</m>. We
          could change the parameter domain. If we have <m>t \in
          [0,8\pi]</m>, then we have four periods of <m>\sin t</m> and
          <m>\cos t</m>, so this traces the same circle four times.
          This is a good example of a parametric curve which traces
          over itself some number of times.

          Curves can quickly get complicated. Consider this curve:
          <m>\gamma(t) = (\cos 3t, \sin 5t)</m>. This gives a lovely
          pattern, perhaps reminiscent of spirographs (depending on
          your childhood experience, of course). The curve is shown
          in <xref ref="figure-parametric-curve2">Figure</xref>.
        </p>
      </statement>

    </figure>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The next example is called the cycloid. Many curves have
          history going back hundreds or thousands of years in
          geometry, as evidenced by their greek names. The cycloid is
          the curve <m>\gamma(t) = (a(t-\sin t), a(1-\cos t))</m>. It
          describes the movement of a point at the edge of a wheel as
          the wheel rolls.

      Many parametric curves are spirals. The general form for a
      spiral is <m>\gamma(t) = (f(t) \cos t, f(t) \sin t)</m> for
      <m>f(t)</m> a positive monotonic function. <m>f(t)</m>
      represents the change in radius as we go around a circle.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The archemidean spiral is this curve: <m>\gamma(t) = (t \cos
          t, t \sin t)</m>. It has linear growth in its radius, so
          there are equally spaced spiral arms.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    </figure>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The hyperbolic spiral is an inward spiral, (it has
          decreasing radius). Its expression is <m>\gamma(t) =
          (\frac{\cos t}{t}, \frac{\sin t}{t})</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

      <caption>The Hyperbolic Spiral</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/figure14" />
    </figure>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The last spiral in our examples is the logarithmic spiral
          which has exponential growth in radius. Its form is
          <m>\gamma(t) = (e^{t} \cos t, e^{t} \sin t)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <figure xml:id="figure-parametric-curve6">
      <caption>The Logarithmic Spiral</caption>
      <image width="100%" source="images/figure15" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      The logarithmic spiral shows up frequently, both in mathematics
      and the natural world. Examples of natural logarithmic spirals
      include nautilus shells and spiral galaxies (though the natural
      application of the logarithmic spiral is not without some
      contraversy).
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A final example, which is not a spiral, is the cardiod. It
          has the form <m>\gamma(t) = ((1-\sin t) \cos t, (1-\sin t)
          \sin t</m>. The name comes from its vaguely heart-shaped
          path.

  <subsection xml:id="reparametrization">
    <title>Reparametrization</title>
    <p>
      A parametric curve is more than just a shape in <m>\RR^2</m>.
      The curve also records the start, end and direction, as well as
      the rate of movement along the shape. All that information
      depends on the <em>parametrization</em>: the way in which
      position depends on the parameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes we want to adjust the movement along the shape, while
      preserving the shape. We can do that by changing the
      parametrization: this is called <em>reparametrization</em>. The
      idea is to replace the parameter <m>t</m> by a new parameter
      <m>s</m>. Say we have a curve <m>\gamma(t) = (x(t),y(t))</m>,
      but we can express <m>t</m> as a function of some other variable
      <m>s</m>, <m>t = t(s)</m>. Then we can replace <m>t</m> with
      <m>t(s)</m> in the definition of the curve (much like we replace
      in a integration substitution). That gives a new
      parametrization of the same curve: <m>\gamma(s) =
      (x(t(s)),y(t(s)))</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circle <m>\gamma(t) = (\cos t, \sin t)</m> can be
      reparametrized in a variety of ways. <m>t(s) = s^2</m> gives the
      new circle <m>\gamma(s) = (\cos s^2, \sin s^2)</m>. Similarly,
      <m>t(s) = \sqrt{s}</m> gives the new circle <m>\gamma(s) = (\cos
      \sqrt{s}, \sin \sqrt{s})</m>. Each reparametrization doesn't
      change the shape, but does change the rate at which we move
      around the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each curve shape in <m>\RR^2</m> has many (infinitely many)
      parametrizations.
