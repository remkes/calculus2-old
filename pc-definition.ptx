    <title>Definition</title>
    <p>
      So far, in this course and in Calculus I, a curve was the locus
      of an equation. In <xref ref="section-algebraic-plane-curves"
      />, I defined a special set of loci called algebraic plane
      curves and work with implicit derivatives to understand their
      shapes, slopes and singularities. A curve, as a locus, is a
      static object, presented all at once by an equation. Sometime,
      however, this presentation isn't sufficient. A curve can
      represent the motion of an object (think of an ellipse
      representing the path of an orbit or a parabola representing the
      path of a projective). In the context of motion, the curve isn't
      presented all at one. I also care about movement along the
      curve: how fast an object is moving, where it is at some point
      in time. This calls for a new treatment of curve. This section
      introduces the idea of a parametric curve, which will capture
      motion along a curve as well as the global shape previously
      described by a locus. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Motion along a curve is capture by a parameter, hence the name:
      parametric curves. This parameter is usually interpreted as
      time, so the variable <m>t</m> is conventional. Here is the
      formal definition. I'll state the definition in <m>\RR^2</m>,
      since I will only be working with curves in the plane in this
      course, but the definition could be stated in any <m>\RR^n</m>. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>t</m> be an indepedent variable (the parameter,
          usually interpreted as time) and let <m>[a,b]</m> be an
          interval in <m>\RR</m>.  A parametric curve in
          <m>\RR^2</m> is a set of two continuous functions <m>x(t)</m> and
          <m>y(t)</m> on the domain <m>[a,b]</m>. These functions
          describe the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>
          coordinates of the curve at any point <m>t</m> in time.
          Though there are two function, it is conventional to refer
          to the curve with one symbol, typically the greek
          letter <m>\gamma</m>.
        </p>
        <me>
          \gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))
        </me>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      To visualize a curve, I can draw all the points <m>\gamma(t) \in
      \RR^2</m> as time range through its domain <m>t \in [a,b]</m>.
      This is notable different from the graph of a function <m>y =
      f(x)</m>. In the graph of a function, both in input and the
      output are shown; the <m>x</m> axis is the input and the
      <m>y</m> axis is the output. For a parametric curve, only the
      output it drawn. There is no <m>t</m> axis; time is an implicit
      idea, thinking of movement along the shape. Since the time axis
      is not show, a parametric curve doesn't need to satisfy any kind
      of vertical line test. It can meander all over the plane, double
      back on itself, or cross over previous section of itself. Any
      direction of movement is possible at any point.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did insist, in the definition, that the functions must be
      continuous. This means that the movement along a parametric
      curve is connected -- no teleportation from once point suddenly
      to somewhere else. For paths and movement, this is a reasonable
      restriction.

    <title>Examples</title>
    <p>
      Like many mathematical objects, the best way to understand
      curves is through examples. I'm going to give many examples in
      this section. 
    </p>
    <example>

              import graph;
              xaxis();
              yaxis();
    
              draw((0,0)--(5,5),Arrow);
              dot("$\gamma(1) = (1,1)$",(1,1),SE);
              dot("$\gamma(2) = (2,2)$",(2,2),SE);
              dot("$\gamma(3) = (3,3)$",(3,3),SE);
              dot("$\gamma(4) = (4,4)$",(4,4),SE);
              dot("$\gamma(5) = (5,5)$",(5,5),SE);
            </asymptote>

        </figure>
        <p>
          Consider the curve <m>\gamma_1(t) = (t,t)</m> for <m>t \in
          [0,5]</m>. This curves gives the line <m>y=x</m>, starting
          at <m>(0,0)</m> and ending at <m>(5,5)</m>. At <m>t=0</m>,
          the curve is at <m>(0,0)</m>, at <m>t=1</m>, it is at
          <m>(1,1)</m>, and so on. All parametric curves are about
          movement: this curve is not only the line <m>y=x</m>, but
          also the starting point <m>(0,0)</m>, the ending point
          <m>(5,5)</m> and the rate of movement along the line.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the curve <m>\gamma_2(t) = (-t,-t)</m> for <m>t \in
          [-5,0]</m>. This is exactly the same line as the previouus
          example, since it still satisfies <m>y=x</m>. However, now
          the curve starts at <m>(5,5)</m> when <m>t=-5</m> and moves
          towards <m>(0,0)</m> when <m>t=0</m>. Different parametric
          curve can describe the same shape with different notions of
          movement along that shape. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Now consider the curve <m>\gamma_3(t) = (t^2,t^2)</m> for
          <m>t \in [0,\sqrt{5}]</m>. Again, this is the same line
          as the previous two examples. Like <m>\gamma_1</m>, it
          starts at <m>(0,0)</m> and ends at <m>(5,5)</m>. However, it
          travels the distance a smaller parameter domain, meaning
          that it moves faster.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

      <statement>
        <p>
          A very important example is <m>\gamma(t) = (\cos t, \sin
          t)</m> for <m>t \in [0,2\pi]</m>. This curve is just the
          unit circle, traced counter clockwise and starting at
          <m>(1,0)</m>. I could change the parameter domain. If we
          have <m>t \in [0,8\pi]</m>, then I have four periods of
          <m>\sin t</m> and <m>\cos t</m>, so this curve traces the
          same circle four times.  This is a good example of a
          parametric curve which traces over itself some number of
          times. Retracing the same shape is perfectly valid for a
          parametric curve.

          perhaps reminiscent of spirographs (depending on your
          childhood experience, of course). The curve is shown in
          <xref ref="figure-parametric-curve2">Figure</xref>. It is a
          good example of the fact that a parametric curve can have
          many self-intersections.

          The next example is called the cycloid (a greek name). Many
          curves have history going back hundreds or thousands of
          years in geometry and have these antiquated greek or latin
          names. The cycloid is the curve <m>\gamma(t) = (a(t-\sin t),
          a(1-\cos t))</m> for <m>t \in [0,\infty]</m>. It describes the
          movement of a point at the edge of a wheel as the wheel
          rolls.

      Many parametric curves are spirals. The general form for a
      spiral is <m>\gamma(t) = (f(t) \cos t, f(t) \sin t)</m> for
      <m>f(t)</m> a positive monotonic function. <m>f(t)</m>
      represents the change in radius while the cosine and sine
      function show (counterclockwise) rotation around the origin.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-reparametrization">
    <title>Reparametrization</title>
    <p>
      A parametric curve is more than just a shape in <m>\RR^2</m>.
      The curve also records the start point, end point, direction,
      and rate of movement along the shape. All that information
      depends on the <em>parametrization</em>: the way in which
      position depends on the parameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I would like to change the direction or speed along a
      curve while keeping the same shape. I can do that by changing
      the parametrization.  Consider a curve <m>\gamma(t) = (x(t),
      y(t))</m> and a function <m>t = g(u)</m> for some
      <em>monotonic</em> function <m>g</m>. Then I can replace
      <m>t</m> in the curve with <m>g(u)</m> to get <m>\gamma(s) =
      (x(g(u)),y(g(u)))</m>. This is called
      <em>reparametrization</em>. Often it is conventional (though
      slighly confusing) to just write <m>t(u)</m> instead of <m>t =
      g(u)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circle <m>\gamma(t) = (\cos t, \sin t)</m> for <m>t \in
      [0,2\pi]</m>  can be reparametrized in a variety of ways.
      <m>t(u) = u^2</m> gives the new circle <m>\gamma(u) = (\cos u^2,
      \sin u^2)</m> with <m>u \in [0, \sqrt{2\pi}]</m> . Similarly,
      <m>t(u) = \sqrt{u}</m> gives the new circle <m>\gamma(u) = (\cos
      \sqrt{u}, \sin \sqrt{u})</m> with <m>u \in [0, (2\pi)^2]</m>.
      Each reparametrization doesn't change the shape, but does change
      the rate at which we move around the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each curve shape in <m>\RR^2</m> has many (infinitely many)
      parametrizations. Any monotonic function <m>t = g(u)</m> can
      give a valid reparametrization, and there are infinitely many
      monotonic functions. This is what makes parametric curves much
      richer than curve as loci: each shape also has an infinite
      variety of movement along the shape.
