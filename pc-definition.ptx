    <title>Definition</title>
    <p>
      So far in the study of calculus, a curve was the locus
      of an equation. In <xref ref="section-algebraic-plane-curves"
      />, I defined a special set of loci called algebraic plane
      curves and worked with implicit derivatives to understand their
      shapes, slopes and singularities. A curve, as a locus, is a
      static object presented by an equation. Sometimes,
      however, this presentation isn't sufficient. A curve can
      represent the motion of an object (think of an ellipse
      representing the path of an orbit or a parabola representing the
      path of a projectile). In the context of motion, the curve isn't
      presented all at once. In addition to the shape of the curve,
      information is needed about 
      how fast an object is moving and where it is at some point
      in time. This calls for a new treatment of curves. This section
      introduces the idea of a parametric curve, which will capture
      motion along a curve as well as describing the shape of the
      curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Motion along a curve is descried by a parameter, hence the name:
      parametric curves. This parameter is usually interpreted as
      time, so the variable <m>t</m> is conventional. Here is the
      formal definition. I'll state the definition in <m>\RR^2</m>,
      since I will only be working with curves in the plane in this
      course, but the definition could be stated in any <m>\RR^n</m>. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>t</m> be an indepedent variable (the parameter,
          usually interpreted as time) and let <m>[a,b]</m> be an
          interval in <m>\RR</m>.  A parametric curve in <m>\RR^2</m>
          is a set of two continuous functions <m>x(t)</m> and
          <m>y(t)</m> on the domain <m>[a,b]</m>. These functions
          describe the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates of the curve
          at any point <m>t</m> in time.  Though there are two
          functions, it is conventional to refer to the curve with one
          symbol, typically the greek letter <m>\gamma</m>.
        </p>
        <me>
          \gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t))
        </me>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      To visualize a curve, I can draw all the points <m>\gamma(t) \in
      \RR^2</m> as time runs through its domain <m>t \in [a,b]</m>.
      This visualization is notably different from drawing the graph
      of a function <m>y = f(x)</m>. In the graph of a function, both
      in input and the output are shown; the <m>x</m> axis is the
      input and the <m>y</m> axis is the output. For a parametric
      curve, only the output it drawn. There is no <m>t</m> axis; time
      is an implicit idea, thinking of movement along the shape. Since
      the time axis is not show, a parametric curve doesn't need to
      satisfy any kind of vertical line test. It can meander all over
      the plane, double back on itself, or cross over previous section
      of itself. Any direction of movement is possible at any point.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did insist, in the definition, that the functions must be
      continuous. This means that the movement along a parametric
      curve is connected <mdash /> no teleportation from once point to
      somewhere else. For paths and movement, this is a reasonable
      restriction.

    <title>Examples</title>
    <p>
      Like many mathematical objects, the best way to understand
      curves is through examples. I'm going to give many examples in
      this section.

              yaxis();
    
              draw((0,0)--(5,5),Arrow);
              dot("$\gamma(1) = (1,1)$",(1,1),SE);
              dot("$\gamma(2) = (2,2)$",(2,2),SE);
              dot("$\gamma(3) = (3,3)$",(3,3),SE);
              dot("$\gamma(4) = (4,4)$",(4,4),SE);
              dot("$\gamma(5) = (5,5)$",(5,5),SE);

        <p>
          Consider the curve <m>\gamma_1(t) = (t,t)</m> for <m>t \in
          [0,5]</m>. This curves gives the line <m>y=x</m>, starting
          at <m>(0,0)</m> and ending at <m>(5,5)</m>. At <m>t=0</m>,
          the curve is at <m>(0,0)</m>; at <m>t=1</m>, it is at
          <m>(1,1)</m>; and so on. All parametric curves are about
          movement: this curve is not only the line <m>y=x</m>, but
          also the starting point <m>(0,0)</m>, the ending point
          <m>(5,5)</m> and the rate of movement along the line.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the curve <m>\gamma_2(t) = (-t,-t)</m> for <m>t \in
          [-5,0]</m>. This is exactly the same line as the previouus
          example, since it still satisfies <m>y=x</m>. However, now
          the curve starts at <m>(5,5)</m> when <m>t=-5</m> and moves
          towards <m>(0,0)</m> when <m>t=0</m>. Different parametric
          curve can describe the same shape with different notions of
          movement along that shape. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Now consider the curve <m>\gamma_3(t) = (t^2,t^2)</m> for
          <m>t \in [0,\sqrt{5}]</m>. Again, this is the same line
          as the previous two examples. Like <m>\gamma_1</m>, it
          starts at <m>(0,0)</m> and ends at <m>(5,5)</m>. However,
          the previous two examples described movement at a fixed
          speed and this example, due to the quadratic terms,
          describes accelerating movement along the shape.

        <p>
          A very important example is the unit circle, which can be
          described as <m>\gamma(t) = (\cos t, \sin t)</m> for <m>t
          \in [0,2\pi]</m>.  This curve traces the circle counter
          clockwise and starts at <m>(1,0)</m>. I could change the
          parameter domain. If <m>t \in [0,8\pi]</m>, then there
          are four periods of <m>\sin t</m> and <m>\cos t</m>, so
          this curve traces the same circle four times.  A parametric
          curve can trace over itself any number of times.

          perhaps reminiscent of spirographs (if those happened to be
          a part of your childhood experience). The curve is shown in
          <xref ref="figure-parametric-curve2">Figure</xref>. It is a
          good example of the fact that a parametric curve can have
          many self-intersections.

          The next example is called the cycloid. <sq>cycliod</sq> is
          a greek word; many curves have history going back hundreds
          or thousands of years in geometry and have greek or latin
          names reflecting that history. The cycloid is the curve
          <m>\gamma(t) = (a(t-\sin t), a(1-\cos t))</m> for <m>t \in
          [0,\infty]</m>.  It describes the movement of a point at the

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-reparametrization">
    <title>Reparametrization</title>
    <p>
      A parametric curve is more than just a shape in <m>\RR^2</m>.
      The curve also records the start point, end point, direction,
      and rate of movement along the shape. All that information
      depends on the <em>parametrization</em>: the way in which
      position depends on the parameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I might like to change the direction or speed along a given
      curve while keeping the same shape. I can do that by changing
      the parametrization.  Consider a curve <m>\gamma(t) = (x(t),
      y(t))</m> and a substitution <m>t = g(u)</m> for some
      <em>monotonic</em> function <m>g</m>. I can replace
      <m>t</m> in the curve with <m>g(u)</m> to get <m>\gamma(u) =
      (x(g(u)),y(g(u)))</m>. This is called
      <em>reparametrization</em>. Often it is conventional (though
      slighly confusing) to just write <m>t(u)</m> instead of <m>t =
      g(u)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circle <m>\gamma(t) = (\cos t, \sin t)</m> for <m>t \in
      [0,2\pi]</m>  can be reparametrized in a variety of ways.
      <m>t(u) = u^2</m> gives the new circle <m>\gamma(u) = (\cos u^2,
      \sin u^2)</m> with <m>u \in [0, \sqrt{2\pi}]</m> . Similarly,
      <m>t(u) = \sqrt{u}</m> gives the new circle <m>\gamma(u) = (\cos
      \sqrt{u}, \sin \sqrt{u})</m> with <m>u \in [0, (2\pi)^2]</m>.
      Each reparametrization doesn't change the shape, but does change
      the rate of movement around the circle. Notice that I need
      to adjust the bounds of the new parametrizations if I want to
      cover the same distance. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Each curve shape in <m>\RR^2</m> has many (infinitely many)
      parametrizations. Any monotonic function <m>t = g(u)</m> can
      give a valid reparametrization, and there are infinitely many
      monotonic functions. This is what makes parametric curves much
      richer than loci: each shape also has an infinite
      variety of movement possibilities along the shape.
