  <title>Absolute and Conditional Convergence</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      This week is devoted to understanding the convergence of series.
      Among convergent series, there is a distincting between two
      kinds of convergences: a stronger and a weaker version.  This
      section explores that distinction via the important example of
      the alternating harmonic series. Let me start with a definition. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\{a_n\}</m> be a sequence such that
          <m>a_n>0 \ \forall n \in \NN</m>. the following
          series is called an alternating series.
        </p>
        <me>
          \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1} a_n
        </me>
        <p>
          Since the <m>a_n</m> are positive, the <m>(-1)^n</m> ensure
          that each consecutive term in the series changes sign, from
          positive to negative back to positive. This is the
          <sq>alternating</sq> that gives the series its name.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Now recall the test for divergence in <xref
      ref="proposition-test-for-divergence" />. From that test, I
      observe that for a series to converge, it is <em>necessary</em>
      but not <em>sufficient</em> for the terms to tend to zero.
      Intuitively, I would be much more convenient if this condition
      was sufficient, but the harmonic series was the counter example.
      For alternating series, it turns it is sufficient.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          (The Alternating Series Test) An alternating series
          converges if and only if the limit of the terms is zero.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p> 
      I won't give a formal proof, the I'll describe the informal
      idea. In an alternating series, in each step of the sum I
      alternatively add and subtract term. The sum is always
      increasing when I add and then decreasing when I subtract. It's
      always jumping forward and then jumping back down. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In that jumping forward and jumping back, if the terms are
      getting smaller, then the jumps are getting smaller as well.
      Therefore, if the terms go to zero, that's enough to ensure that
      this foward and backward pattern will eventually convergence on
      some value.

    <title>The Alternating Harmonic Series</title>
    <p>
      To further understand the convergence of alternative series,
      I'll work with a specific and important example. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The alternating harmonic series is the harmonic series with
          <m>(-1)^n</m> in the numerator.
        </p>
        <me>
          \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} +
          \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \ldots
        </me>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      This series converges by the alternating series test.  It is
      difficult to prove, but the value of the series is <m>\ln 2</m>.
      However, very strange things happen when I try to re-arrange the
      terms of the harmonic series. Consider the following series. 
    </p> 
    <md>
      <mrow>
        \amp  1 + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{5} +
        \frac{1}{7} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{11} -
        \frac{1}{6} + \ldots
      </mrow>
    </md>
    <p>
      I'm going to do some strange arithmetic here. I can express this
      series as the following sum. I think about adding the two series
      term-wise, adding each term in the second row to the term above
      it. Hopefully, you can see that doing so will cancel half the
      terms and add up to exactly the terms of the previous series in
      the othter terms.
    </p>
    <md>
      <mrow>
        \amp  = 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} +
        \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{7} - \frac{1}{8} +
        \ldots
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \amp  \hspace{0.2cm} + 0 + \frac{1}{2} + 0 - \frac{1}{4} + 0
        + \frac{1}{6} + 0 - \frac{1}{8} + \ldots
      </mrow>
    </md>
    <p>
      The first series is the harmonic series. If I factor
      <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> out of the second series, it is also the
      harmonic series. We use the known value of <m>\ln 2</m> for
      the harmonic series to calculate the value of this
      series.
    </p>
    <md>
      <mrow>
        \amp  = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} + \frac{1}{2}
        \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} = \ln 2 + \frac{1}{2}
        \ln 2 = \frac{3}{2} \ln 2
      </mrow>
    </md>
    <p>
      This looks reasonable as well, but what are the terms of this
      series?  Let me simply list the positive and negative term in
      order. The positive terms are <m>\{
      1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{7}, \ldots \}</m> and the
      negative terms are <m>\{ \frac{-1}{2}, \frac{-1}{4},
      \frac{-1}{6}, \ldots \}</m>.  These are exactly the same terms
      at the alternating harmonic series, just in a different order.
      However, the alternating harmonic series summed to <m>\ln 2</m>,
      not <m>\frac{3}{2} \ln 2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems I can re-arrange the alternating harmonic series to
      sum to a different number.  This is exceedingly odd: for finite
      sums, any re-arrangement was irrelevant to the value of the sum.
      It seems, for infinite sums, re-arrangement can actually change
      the value.  There is an important result which is even
      stranger.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any real number <m>\alpha</m>, there is a re-arrangement
          of the alternating harmonic series that sums to
          <m>\alpha</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        This is a very strange result, but the proof has a remarkably
        simple argument. First, groups the terms as positive and
        negative, as I did before. Each set of terms is asymptotically
        similar to the (non-alternating) harmonic series, so each set
        sums to <m>\pm \infty</m> (or <m>-\infty</m> for the negative
        terms).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let <m>\alpha</m> be any real number. I will start by adding
        positive terms until I get past <m>\alpha</m>. (This can
        always be done, since the positive terms by themslves sum to
        <m>\infty</m>).  Then, when the sum so far is larger than
        <m>\alpha</m>, I start adding negative terms until I get back
        below <m>\alpha</m> again.
        (Again, this can always be done, since the negative terms sum
        to <m>-\infty</m>). Then I simply repeat this process, adding
        positives until we get above <m>\alpha</m> and negatives until
        we get back below <m>\alpha</m>. This process can be
        continued indefinitely. Since both the positive and negative
        terms get arbitrarily small, this process will invariably
        converge on <m>\alpha</m> in the limit.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There are some regular arrangements of the alternating
          harmonic which have specific values.  Let <m>A(m,n)</m> be
          the sum formed by adding <m>m</m> positive terms followed by
          <m>n</m> negative terms and repeating this pattern.  (As
          before, the positive and negative terms are taken in
          decreasing order.)  It can be proved that this converges to
          certain values of the logarithm.
        </p>
        <me>
          A(m,n) = \ln 2 + \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{m}{n} \right)
        </me>.
        <p>
          In particular, the combination of one positive and four
          negative terms sums to zero.

      The alternating harmonic series was a conditionally convergent
      series, since the (non-alternating) harmonic series diverges.
      The behaviour that I demonstrated for the alternating harmonic
      series is the same for <em>any</em> conditionally convergent
      series.

        <p>
          An absolutely convergent series converges to the same value

          series can be rearranged to converge to any real number.
