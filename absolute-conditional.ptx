      Among convergent series, there is a distincting between a
      stronger and a weaker kind of convergence.  This section
      explores that distinction via the important example of the
      alternating harmonic series.

          If we have a sequences of terms <m>\{a_n\}</m> such that
          <m>a_n>0 \ \forall n \in \NN</m>, then the following
          expression is called an alternating series.
          <me>
            \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1} a_n

      In an alternating series, each term has a different sign from
      the previous term.  Recall the test for divergence: for
      convergence, is it <em>necessary</em> but not
      <em>sufficient</em> for the terms to tend to zero.  Intuitively,
      we would like to have sufficiency as well, but the harmonic
      series was the counter example.  For alternating series, we get
      our wish.

    <title>The Alternating Harmonic Series</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The alternating harmonic series is the harmonic series with
          <m>(-1)^n</m> in the numerator.
          <me>
            \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} +
            \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \ldots

      This series converges by the alternating series test.  It is
      difficult to prove, but the value is <m>\ln 2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must be very careful here.  Consider the following series,
      which is a pattern of two positive terms with odd denominators
      followed by one negative term with an even denominator.

          \frac{1}{6} + \ldots

        <intertext>
          We write this series in a strange new way: as the difference
          of the alternating harmonic series and another series with
          only even denominators. You can see, if you add the two
          series, how some of the terms cancel and other add to the
          correct terms in the original.

          The first series is the harmonic series. If we factor
          <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> out of the second series, it is also the
          harmonic series. We use the known value of <m>\ln 2</m> for
          the harmonic series to calculate the value of this
          series.

      This looks reasonable as well, but what are the terms of this
      series?  If we group them by sign, the positive terms are <m>\{
      1, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{7}, \ldots \}</m> and the
      negative terms are <m>\{ \frac{-1}{2}, \frac{-1}{4},
      \frac{-1}{6}, \ldots \}</m>.  These are exactly the same terms
      at the alternating harmonic series, just in a different order.
      However, the alternating harmonic series summed to <m>\ln 2</m>,
      not <m>\frac{3}{2} \ln 2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems we can re-arrange the alternating harmonic series to
      sum to a different number.  This is exceedingly odd: for finite
      sums, any re-arrangement was irrelevant to the value of the sum.
      It seems, for infinite sums, re-arrangement can actually change
      the value.  There is an important result which is even
      stranger.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any real number <m>\alpha</m>, there is a re-arrangement
          of the alternating harmonic series that sums to
          <m>\alpha</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        This is a very strange result, but the proof has a remarkably
        simple argument.First, groups the terms as positive and
        negative.  Each set of terms is asymptotically similar to the
        (non-alternating) harmonic series, so each set sums to <m>\pm
        \infty</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then choose a real number <m>\alpha</m>.  Start adding
        positive terms until we get past <m>\alpha</m>. (This can
        always be done, since the possitive terms by themslves sum to
        <m>\infty</m>).  Then, when we are past <m>\alpha</m>, start
        adding negative terms until we're below <m>\alpha</m> again.
        (Again, this can always be done, since the negative terms sum
        to <m>-\infty</m>).  Then simply repeat this process, adding
        positives until we get above <m>\alpha</m> and negatives until
        we get back below <m>\alpha</m>.  This process can be
        continued indefinitely, and since the terms get arbitrarily
        small, we will approach <m>\alpha</m> in the limit.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There are some regular arrangements of the alternating
          harmonic which have specific values.  Let <m>A(m,n)</m> be
          the sum where we take <m>m</m> positive terns, then <m>n</m>
          negative, then back to <m>m</m> positive and so on.  It can
          be proved that this converges to
          <me>
            A(m,n) = \ln 2 + \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{m}{n} \right)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, the combination of one positive and four
          negative terms sums to zero.

      The alternating harmonic series was a conditionally convergent
      series, since the (non-alternating) harmonic series diverges.
      The behaviour that we saw for the alternating harmonic series is
      the same for <em>any</em> conditionally convergent series.
