  <title>Convergence and Values of Infinite Series</title>
  <p>
    After defining series, in <xref ref="subsection-series-examples"
    />, I use partial sums to calculate the actual value of series.
    For geometric and telescoping series, I could produce actual
    values, usual rational numbers, for the sum of the series. Those
    were useful initial examples, but it turns out they were a bit
    misleading. For the vast majority of series, when the series does
    actual converge to a value, the value of the series is not going
    to be a familiar rational number (or even a familiar irrational
    numbers). Most series that do converge will converge to some new,
    unfamiliar number. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This reality changes the nature of the discussion of series. The
    na√Øve approach to series is to ask: <dq>What number does this
    series add up to?</dq>. That question assumes that the result will
    be familiar <emdash /> that series produce recognizable answers.
    If this is not the case, then I need to change the question to
    this: <dq>Is this series a number?</dq> That is, does the series
    actually converge.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this spirit, what I care about is convergence, not calculation.
    If a series arises in some mathematical problem, what I most need
    to know is if it actually represents a number. I usually don't
    need to know, at least at the start, roughly what the number is. I
    just need the confidence that there is a number, which I can then
    use for other purposes and calculation.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this entire week, I'll be introducing tests for convergence.
    These are various ways that I can determine whether a series
    converges: whether the I can treat it as a reasonable,
    well-defined number or not. I'm not going to actually try to
    calculate the values. The important matheamtics here is
    convergence, not calculation of values. 
  </p>
  <p>
    To try to make this point, conisder the following series. 
  </p>
  <me>
    \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^2+4n}{(n!)2^n}
  </me>
  <p>
    Using methods from later in this week, this series converges. This
    sum represents a number. Let me label that number.
  </p>
  <me>
    \alpha = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^2+4n}{(n!)2^n}
  </me>
  <p>
    Now I can do arithemtic with <m>\alpha</m>. I can use it in other
    equations, in other functions, in other series even. It is
    probably not a familiar number. I probably don't have any other
    way to succinct write <m>\alpha</m> other than as this series.
    The series is the best way to refer to the number. The key is that
    I am assured that the series converges, that <m>\alpha</m> is some
    number.
  </p>
  <p>
    Though the focus of this week is on convergence, eventually, I
    might like to know the rough value of the number. Though I can't
    likely <sq>calculate</sq> the series by writing <m>\alpha</m> as
    some familiar number, I can use the series to approximate the
    number. For example, here is the fourth partial sum of the series. 
  </p>
  <me>
    \frac{5}{2} + \frac{12}{8} + \frac{21}{48} + \frac{32}{384} =
    \frac{217}{48}
  </me>
  <p>
    This is an approximation for <m>\alpha</m>.  If I add more terms,
    I will get a closer approximation. This is the best way to get a
    representation of <m>\alpha</m> in familiar terms. I could wonder
    how accurate this approximation is.  The accuracy and precision of
    series  approximation is an important question in the study of
    infinite series and itself is a bit part of mathematics. In this
    course, I'll not cover much about accuracy of approximation with
    series. However, this will be covered in other courses and is
    particular important for numerical analysis and algorithm analysis
    in computing science. Indeed, all the work that computers and
    calculators do to calculate values of functions is approximation
    work, which requires careful control of the error to ensure that
    answers are given to the expected precision.
