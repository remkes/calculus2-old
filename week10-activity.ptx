        <p>
          I can use asymptotical analysis for this limit. The
          numerator has asymptotic order <m>n^2</m> and the
          denominator has asymptotic order <m>n^3</m>. The denominator
          has a higher asymptotic order, so the limit must be 0.

      <solution>
        <p>
          I can use asymptotical analysis for this limit, even though
          the factorial is a new expression. As mentioned in the
          notes, the factorial grows faster than exponential
          functions. Therefore, the denominator has a higher
          asymptotic order and the limit must be 0.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          I can use asymptotical analysis for this limit. The
          asymptotic order of the numerator is <m>n^2</m>. The
          asymptotic order of the denominator is the same (the sine
          function is bounded, so it has no effect on growth). The
          asymptotic orders are the same, so I look at the leading
          coefficients, which are <m>\frac{1}{1}</m>. Therefore, the
          limit is 1.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          I can use asymptotical analysis for this limit. The
          logarithm grows slower than a linear function, so the
          denominator has a higher asymptotic order and the limit must
          be 0.

      <solution>
        <p>
          This is a bit of a trick question. It looks like there are
          alternating terms, so like the sequences with terms
          <m>(-1)^n</m>, there could be an argument that the limit
          doesn't exist. However, every term in the limit has <m>\sin
          (\pi n)</m> and, for sequences, <m>n \in \NN</m>. Sine of
          any multiple of <m>\pi</m> is zero, so all the terms of the
          sequence are 0. Therefore, the limit is also zero.

        <p>
          The denoiminator is growing arbitrarity large, since the
          square root is an increasing, unbounded function. Dividing
          by large numbers give small numbers, so the ration is
          approaching zero. The fact that it keeps changing sign
          between positive and negative doesn't matter, since the
          terms are still getting closer and closer to zero. The limit
          is 0.

        <p>
          This is an extremely chaotic limit. The function <m>\tan n</m>
          take all kinds of values since the argument is not a
          multiple of <m>\pi</m> and no regular behaviour can be
          expected. Since the terms are just jumping around all over
          the place, there is no convergence and the limit cannot
          exist.

        <p>
          I can use asymptotical analysis for this limit. The
          asymptotic order of the numerator is <m>e^n</m>. The
          asymptotic order of the denominator is <m>e^{2n} =
          (e^n)^2 = e^n e^n </m>. The denominator has a higher
          asymptotic order, so the limit must be zero.

          This is interest, there are two possible limit. Which one is
          the limit of this sequence? Well, one limit is positive and
          one limit is negative. The sequences starts with <m>a_1 =
          1</m> and the recursion relation only produces positive
          numbers, so the limit must be positive. I conclude the limit
          is <m>L = \frac{3 + \sqrt{17}}{2}</m>.

          The quadratic has no solutions. Does that mean there is no
          limit? Indeed, it does. Even more, this sequence has more
          significant problems. With <m>a_1 = 1</m>, the recusion
          relation gives <m>a_2 = 0</m>. Then if I try to calcualte
          <m>a_3</m>, there is division by zero. Therefore, this
          sequences isn't even defined, so it certainly can't have a
          limit.

          This question generalizes the two previous questions, trying
          to look for a general statement about limits of this type of
          recursive sequence.  Assume that <m>a_n</m> are the terms of
          a recursive sequnce with <m>a_1 = 1</m> and with the
          following recursive relationship, where <m>\alpha, \beta \in
          \RR</m>.

          What is the limit of the sequence? How does the limit depend
          on <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>? What are the conditions
          on <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> that allow for the limit
          to exists? What are the possible behaviours?

          The detemination of ths limit depends on the roots of this
          quadratic. If the quadratic has no roots, if <m>\alpha^2 + 4
          \beta \lt 0</m>, then the sequence will not converge to any
          limit. If <m>\alpha^2 + 4 \beta = 0</m>, then there is a
          unique root of <m>\frac{\alpha}{2}</m> and the sequence will
          approach that root. Finally, if <m>\alpha^2 + 4 \beta \gt
          0</m>, theen there are two roots and the sequence will
          appraoch one of the two roots depending on the starting
          value.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to this discussion, I also have to be aware that
          some starting values will lead to division by zero in the
          recurrence relation, as happened in the previous question.
          That is another way in which the sequence can fail to have a
          limit.

            These partial sums will endlessly oscillate between
            <m>0</m>
            and <m>1</m>. There is no limit to the sequence of partial
            sums, so the series cannot converge.

            These partial sums are simply unbouded. The series grows
            to infinity. Equivalently, the test for divergence and the
            fact that the terms do not go to zero shows that
            convergence is impossible.

            As <m>\frac{1}{n!}</m> tends towards zero, the value of the
            logarithm tends towards <m>-\infty</m>, so this series will
            also diverge to <m>-\infty</m>.
