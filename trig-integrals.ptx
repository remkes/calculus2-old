  <title>Trigonometric Integrals</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      This weeks sections will complete the study of the techniques
      of integration. I'll start with integrals involving
      trigonometric functions.  The trigonometric integrals in the
      tables are limited to a small number of basic antiderivatives. In
      this section, I want to expand the repertoire for trigonometric
      integrals. (Though you don't need to memorize, it is valuable to
      be familiar with which trig functions are already in the tables
      for antiderivatives. This can save you a bunch of work if you
      find a trig function which is on the table and you can simply
      look up the antiderivative.)

    <title>Strategies for Products and Quotients</title>
    <p>
      I will first consider integrands which are products of
      trigonometric functions, such as <m>\sin^2 x \cos^3 x</m> or
      <m>\tan^4 x \sec^2 x</m>. In particular, these types of integral
      are useful for the technique in <xref
      ref="section-trig-substitutions" />. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When I have a product or quotient of trig functions, there are
      two main strategies I want to apply.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>
        Change everthing into sine and cosines, to hopefully use a
        substitution <m>u = \sin x</m> or <m>u = \cos x</m>. 
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Use tangent, secant, cosecant and cotangent to write
        everything in the the numerator and see if a substitution
        involving trig functions other than sine or cosine is
        reasonable.
      </p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      There is no guarantee (as always, with integrals) that either of
      these strategies will work. However, they are successful in many
      examples. Instead of further discussion the strategy in the
      abstract, I'll move on to examples of both of these techniques.
      However, before the examples, I want to introduce another idea
      that can save a lot of calcultion.

  <title>Symmetry and Definite Integrals</title>
    <p>
      The basic trig functions oscillate up and down. When I integrate
      a trig function, I often will have area above and below the axis
      form this oscillation. Sometimes, if the trig functions have a
      particular form, the areas above and below will cancel off and
      the integral will be zero. If I am observant, I might be able to
      notice this fact before even starting a calculation. If I can
      notice this, I'll say the integral is zero by symmetry. Consider
      this first example:
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_0^{2\pi} \sin x dx 
    </me>
    <p>
      This is an integral over a full period of the sine function. In
      a full period, there are equal pieces above and below the axis,
      therefore this integral is zero by symmetry. I don't need to
      calculate it <emdash /> I just need to observe that it must be
      zero. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Integrals over one period are the most obvious case of this
      symmetry argument, but it applies more broadly. Consider this
      inetgral.
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos x dx 
    </me>
    <p>
      This is an integral over half a period, so the full period
      argument doesn't apply. However, on this half-period, cosine
      still is symmetric above and below the axis. On <m>\left[
      \frac{-\pi}{2}, 0 \right]</m>, cosine is negative. On <m>
      \left[0, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]</m>, cosine is positive. These
      two shapes and areas are identical, so these two areas cancel
      out and the integral is zero. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If I take an odd power of a trig function, this argument still
      works. 
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_0^{2\pi} \sin^7 x dx 
    </me>
    <p>
      This is an integral over a whole period. The positive and
      negative parts are still perfect mirrors of each other, so this
      integral is zero. Note, however, that this doesn't work for even
      powers. If I integrate <m>\sin^2 x</m> over a whole period, I do
      not get zero. When I take an even power, the result is always
      positive; there are no pieces at all below thte axis to cancel
      off. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, adjustments of period can come into play. Consider this
      integral. 
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_0^{\frac{2\pi}{3}} \sin (3x) dx 
    </me>
    <p>
      In <m>\sin (3x)</m>, the period is one third of the original
      period. The bounds of this integral are likewise also one third of
      the conventional period. Therefore, this is also an integral
      over a whole period, so the positive and negative pieces of the
      integral cancel off and the integral must be zero.

  <title>Examples</title>
    <p>
      The goal of the first technique to change everything to sine or
      cosine is to use a substitution with either of those functions.
      If <m>u = \sin x</m> then <m>du = \cos x dx</m>; the sine
      substitution needs a cosine with the <m>dx</m> term. The same is
      true for the cosine substitution: it needs a sine with the
      <m>dx</m> term. Therefore, changing everything to sine or cosine
      is going to be successful if I can make everything into sine,
      leaving only <m>\cos x dx</m>, or vice versa, make everything
      into cosine leaving only <m>\sin x dx</m>. The definitions of
      the other four trig functions can be used to write everything in
      terms of sine and cosine. Then the square identity (<m>\sin^2 x
      + \cos^2 x = 1</m>) can be used to change any instance of
      <m>\sin^2 x</m> into <m>1 - \cos^2 x</m>, or vice versa. If
      these manipulations can be done to leave only one sine or only
      one cosine, then this strategy will be effective.

          Here is an integral that is already setup for the

          it can act as the derivative of the <m>u = \cos x</m>
          substitution. I proceed with the substitution, after which I
          split this up into two integrals in <m>u</m>, integrate, and
          reverse the substitution.

      So far, I have been looking for situations where I
      could isolate sine or cosine and change everything into the
      other function. If sine and cosine show up both with even
      powers, then this is impossible to do with the square identity.
      However, if both show up with an even exponent, I can use the
      half-angle identities instead. The next example
      shows the use of these half-angle identities and the resulting
      (admittedly complicated) algebra to finish the integral.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Here, I have even powers of both sine and cosine. By writing
          <m>\cos^4 t</m> as <m>(\cos^2 t)^2</m>, I can replace both
          <m>\sin^2 t</m> and <m>\cos^2 t</m> by their half-angle
          identities. After this substitution, I expand the various
          binomials and split up the resulting integral by linearity.

          The first and second of these integrals can be done
          directly. For the third, since it is an isolated even power,
          I can repeat the half-angle identity replacement. (Note that
          since this is already <m>\cos (2t)</m>, the half-angle will
          give <m>\cos (4t)</m>. The fourth integral is zero by
          symmetry. The period of <m>\cos (2t)</m> is <m>\pi</m> and
          the integral is over this whole period.  Since this is an

      The second strategy for trig integrals is to write everything as
      numerators and possibly use another substitution of a trig
      function. The next example makes use of the 
      derivative patterns of tangent and secant and the identity 
      <m>1 + \tan^2 x = \sec^2 x</m>. Specifically, 
      with the derivative  <m>\frac{d}{dx} \tan x = \sec^2 x</m>, if
      everything is expressed as tangent except a lone <m>\sec^2
      x</m> term, then ths substitution <m>u = \tan x</m> should work
      nicely.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          This example is already given entirely as tangents and
          secants, with everything in the numerator. The power of
          secant is even, so I can solve <m>\sec^2 x</m>. I can write
          the remaining <m>\sec^2 x</m> as <m>(1 + \tan^2 x)</m>.
          Therefore, I'll use the substitution
          <m>u = \tan x</m> with <m>du = \sec^2 x dx</m>. Since this
          is a definite integral, I can also change the bounds with
          the substitution:  <m>u(0) = 0</m>, <m>u\left(\frac{\pi}{3}
          \right) = \sqrt{3}</m>. After the substitution, this is an
          integral of polynomial terms, which I can split up with
          linearity, use the power rule to find antiderivaitves, and
          evaluate on the bounds.

          I could have solved this integral using my first method as

          do that as well in this example, to show that the result is
          the same. (This also demonstrate the important point that
          for some integrals, multiple different techniques can all be
