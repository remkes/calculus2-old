    <title>Strategies</title>
    <p>
      The trigonometric integrals we've seen so far have been simple
      anti-derivatives or integrals found on standard tables. In this
      section, we want to expand our repertoire for trigonometric
      integrals. We will mostly be considering integrands which are
      products of trigonometric functions, such as <m>\sin^2 x \cos^3
      x</m> or <m>\tan^4 x \sec^2 x</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several strategies, depending on the form of the
      integrand. We have a lot of flexibility with trigonometric
      functions, due to the many identities we can apply. There are
      two general strategies. First, it is often helpful to translate
      everything into sine and cosine. Second, working in the
      opposite direction, it is often helpful to use trig definition
      to remove fractions, so that we only have numerators.

    <p>
      We first look at integrands which involve sine and cosine. Here
      there are also several strategies. The first strategy is
      substitution, if it works. The most obvious case is when we have
      an expression entirely involving sine which is multiplied by
      cosine, or vice-versa. These integrals allow for an easy
      substitution.

      If a sine or cosine terms shows up with an odd exponent, such as
      <m>\sin^7 x</m> or <m>\cos^3 x</m>, we can make use of the
      standard identity <m>\sin^2 + \cos^2 =1</m> to remove all but one
      of the sine or cosine terms. This can be a way to make more
      complicated examples into easy substitutions.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Here cosine shows up with an odd exponent. We change all but
          one power of cosine into sine and then use the obvious
          substitution.

      If we have an expression in sine and cosine where both have even
      powers, the previous trick doesn't help. However, we can use
      half-angle identities to reduce the exponents. The next example
      shows the use of these half-angle identities and the resulting
      (admittedly complicated) algebra to finish the integral.

      Sometime when we try to work without denominators, we can't
      express everything in terms of sine and cosine. However, there
      are integrals than can be entirely expressed in terms of tangents
      and secant (or cotangent and cosecent). Like sine and cosine
      above, there are some nice strategies for integrals involving
      tangent and secant. We can change squares of tangents into
      squares of secant using <m>1 + \tan^2 x = \sec^2 x</m>. We also
      know that <m>\frac{d}{dx} \tan x = \sec^2 x</m>, so if we can
      isolate a <m>\sec^2 x</m> term in an integrand and express
      everything else in terms of tangent, a substitution of <m>u = \tan
      x</m> should work nicely.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Here is an example of a tangent/secant integrand, which we can
          solve two ways. In the first method, we convert everything to
          cosine and sine and use the techniques mentioned previously.
          We work towards a substitution <m>u = \cos x</m> with <m>du =
          -\sin x dx</m> and <m>u(0) = 1</m>, <m>u(\frac{\pi}{3}) =

      Other forms of trigonometric integrals call for the use of other
      identities. Since there are so many types of trigonometric
      function and trigonometric identity, often these integrals require
      creativity and persistance. Also, because of all the identities
      involved, there are often numerous successful approaches. This
      should be celebrated, but it does require caution: often two
      answers from two different process can look very dissimilar. Both
      may be correct anti-derivatives, but a long and complicated series
      of identities would be required to relate them. It's very useful
      to remember that correct answers can have very different forms
      while still being equal.
