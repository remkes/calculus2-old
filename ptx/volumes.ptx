    <title>Volumes by Cross-Sectional Slices</title>
    <p>
      For parametric curves,
      we approached the length of a curve by defining an infinitesimal length <m>ds</m> and then using integration to <sq>add up</sq> all the infinitesimals.
      <me>
        L = \int ds
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This technique of thinking in infinitesimals is useful for many applications of integration.
      In this section, we're going to use it to calculate volumes.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A basic example is the volume of a sphere.
          In these infinitesimal arguments,
          we need to divide the object into pieces,
          either slices or more complicated shapes,
          which have an infinitesimal thickness.
          For the sphere, we divide it into infinitesimally thin discs.
          Let's say the sphere of radius <m>r</m> is centered at the origin in <m>\RR^3</m>.
          We slice it into vertical slices with circular cross sections.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is the radius of each disc?
          If we look at a cross-section of the middle of the sphere,
          we get the circle <m>x^2 + y^2 = r^2</m>.
          If our slices are vertical,
          then their radius is simply the <m>y</m> value <m>y = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}</m>.
          Then, as we move from <m>x = -r</m> to <m>x = r</m>,
          we get all the radii from <m>0</m> to <m>r</m> and back to <m>0</m> again.
          All of these discs have thickness <m>dx</m>,
          an infinitesimal, and area <m>\pi y^2 = \pi (r^2 - x^2)</m>.
          Then we just add up all the infinitesimal pieces in an integral.
          <md>
            <mrow>V \amp  = \int_{-r}^r A dx = \int_{-r}^r \pi (r^2 - x^2) dx</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \pi \int_{-r}^r r^2 - x^2 dx = \left. \pi r^2 x - \pi \frac{x^3}{3} \right|_{-r}^r</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp  = \pi r^3 - (-\pi r^3) - \left( \frac{\pi r^3}{3} + \frac{\pi r^3}{3} \right) = 2\pi r^3 - \frac{2\pi r^3}{3} = \frac{4\pi r^3}{3}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is the conventional old formula for the volume of a sphere.

          A slightly more involed example is the volume of a parabaloid of height <m>h</m> and radius <m>a</m>.
          The parabaloid is described by the function
          <m>y = h \left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^2</m> rotated around the <m>y</m> axis.
          We have <m>x \in [0, a]</m> and <m>y \in [0, h]</m>.
          (Many of these volume problems can be expressed as surfaces of revolution:
          take a function and revolve it around a axis.)
          To add up the slices, we move in the <m>y</m> direction.
          At each <m>y</m> the radius is <m>x = a\sqrt{\frac{y}{h}}</m>.
          The area is <m>\pi x^2 = \frac{\pi a^2 y}{h}</m> and the thickness is <m>dy</m>.

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          We get a volume equation which is similar to a cone
          <m>\left(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\right)</m> but divided by <m>2</m> instead of <m>3</m>.

    <title>Volumes by Spherical or Cylindrical Shells</title>
    <p>
      In the previous section,
      we used cross-sectional slices,
      slicing with a plane to produce the circles.
      However, there are other ways to slice up a volume.
      In this section, we look at the general method of shells.
      Instead of slicing with a plane,
      we think of a volume as a nested collection of similar shapes called shells.
      You could think of the (rough) spheres that form an onion,
      or stacking Matryoshka dolls.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we think of the shells as infinitesimally thin, with thickness <m>dr</m>,
      then we can add up all the infinitesimal volumes of the shells just as with did with slices in the previous section.
      We use <m>dr</m> as the infinitesimal thickness,
      since we often arrange the shells in a radial direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our examples in this section will use cylindrical shells.
      If we have a cylinder with radius <m>r</m> and height <m>h</m>,
      its surface area is <m>A = 2\pi r h</m>.
      A cylindrial shell will have thickness <m>dr</m>,
      so infinitesimal volumes is <m>dV = 2\pi r h dr</m>.
      To find a volume,
      we express <m>h</m> as a function of <m>r</m>, and integrate.
    </p>

          For an example,
          consider a pottery bowl whose cross section is roughly the area between <m>x^2</m> and <m>x^4</m> on the interval <m>[-1,1]</m>.

          The Horn of Gabriel is a surface of revolution under the graph of
          <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m> for <m>x \in [1,\infty)</m>.
          We can use an improper integral to calculate its volume.
          <me>
            V = \int_1^\infty \pi \frac{1}{x^2} = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \int_1^a \frac{\pi}{x^2} = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \left. \frac{-\pi}{x} \right|_1^a = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \frac{-\pi}{a} + \pi = \pi

        <p>
          The volume is finite!
          Even though the Horn of Gabriel extends to infinity,
          it narrows quickly enough that it only contains a finite volume.

          An interesting example is the calculation of the volume of a torus.
          A torus is defined by a larger radius <m>a</m>,
          which is the distance from the centre of the torus to the centre of any cross-sectional circle,
          and a smaller radius <m>b</m>,
          which is the radius of any cross-sectional circle.

          The cross section of a torus consists of two circles.

        <p>
          When we take a cross section,
          we get the circle <m>(x-a)^2 + y^2 = b^2</m>.
          We can solve for <m>y = \sqrt{b^2 - (x-a)^2}</m>.
          This is only half the height of a cylindrical shell, so <m>h = 2y</m>.
          Then <m>x</m> is the radius,
          so we can write <m>h = 2 \sqrt{b^2 - (r-a)^2}</m> We will integrate from <m>a-b</m> to <m>a+b</m> in <m>r</m>,
          to cover one of the cross-sectional circles.

          Therefore, the volume of a torus with major radius <m>a</m> and minor radius <m>b</m> is <m>2\pi^2 a^2 b</m>.
          As a curious obvservation, we can write this as <m>(2\pi a)(\pi b^2)</m>.
          The <m>2\pi a</m> factor is the circumference of the large circle with radius <m>a</m>,
          which lies at the center of each cross-sectional circle.
          The <m>\pi b^2</m> factor is the radius of each cross-sectional circle.
          Therefore, the torus has the same volume of a cylinder with height equal to this circumference and radius <m>b</m>.
