  <title>Theorems of Calculus</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, I'd like to simply list several useful theorems that relation to limits,
      continuity and calculus.
      If this were a more formal course,
      a majority of our time might be spent on these theorems and their implications.
      For our purposes, though,
      you should know that these theorem exists and you should have a reasonable interpretation for their meaning.
      Theorems are also an important aspect of formalization:
      as mathematics becomes formalized,
      we insist on theorems and proofs to build up the formal structure.

    <title>The Intermediate Value Theorem</title>
    <p>
      First, let's review continuity.
      There are several ways to define continuity; I prefer this definition: A function <m>f</m> is continuous at a point <m>a</m> if <m>a</m> is in the domain of <m>f</m> and
      <me>
        \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = f(a)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a continuous function, the limit is just the function value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our first theorem is the Intermediate Value Theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f(x)</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and if
          <m>f(a) \lt c \lt f(b)</m> or <m>f(b)\lt c \lt f(a)</m>,
          then there exists <m>x_0\in (a,b)</m> such that <m>f(x_0) = c</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This is stated formally, but the idea is relatively understandable.
      This theorem simply says that a continuous function must go through all its intermediate values.
      If <m>f(0) = 0</m> and <m>f(1) = 4</m>,
      then all numbers between <m>0</m> and <m>4</m> are intermediate values.
      The theorem says that somewhere in the interval <m>(0,1)</m>,
      the function takes all these intermediate values at least once.
      It can't skip or jump:
      it can't go from 0 to 4 without also going throuth <m>1, 2, 3, \frac{3}{2}, \sqrt{2}, \pi</m>, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      A common application of the IVT is looking for roots of difficult functions.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the quintic <m>f(x) = x^5 - x^4 + 2x^3 - 2x^2 + 2x - 1</m>.
          Since this is a quintic,
          there is no formula like the quadratic formula to find the roots
          (the insolvability of the quintic by a formula is,
          in itself, a very interesting piece of mathematics).
          Using the IVT, if we can find a value values where the function is positive and another where the function is negative,
          we can look for a root between those values.
          In the following list,
          each pair of successive function values is both positive and negative.
          The IVT says that a root must lie between these values.
          For convenience of notation, let <m>a</m> be the desired root.

          This process gives us a reasonable approximation of the root in <m>\frac{174}{256}</m>.

    <title>Rolle's Theorem and Mean Value Theorem</title>
    <p>
      We move on to theorems related to differentiation.
      The first is Rolle's Theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m>,
          continuously differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>
          (note the difference in intervals)
          and if <m>f(a) = f(b)</m>,
          then there exists <m>c \in (a,b)</m> such that <m>f^\prime(c) = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Interpreted as movement in one dimension, Rolle's theorem says that if we get back to where we started,
      we must turn around.
      Getting back to where we started is <m>f(a) = f(b)</m>.
      Turning around is having a point where there is zero rate of change,
      where our velocity changes from going out to going back in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very similar to Rolle's theorem is the Mean Value Theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m>,
          continuously differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>,
          then there exists a value <m>c \in (a,b)</m> such that
          <me>
            f^\prime(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Interpreted as movement in one dimension,
      the MVT says that at some point in time,
      we realize our average rate of change.
      The term on the right is the average rate of change and the theorem says that there is a point <m>c</m> where the derivative,
      the actual rate of change, is equal to this average change.
      At other points in time, we might be moving slower or faster,
      but somewhere we achieve the average speed at least once.
