    <title>Strategies</title>
    <p>
      The trigonometric integrals we've seen so far have been simple anti-derivatives or integrals found on standard tables.
      In this section,
      we want to expand our repertoire for trigonometric integrals.
      We will mostly be considering integrands which are products of trigonometric functions,
      such as <m>\sin^2 x \cos^3 x</m> or <m>\tan^4 x \sec^2 x</m>.

      There are several strategies,
      depending on the form of the integrand.
      We have a lot of flexibility with trigonometric functions,
      due to the many identities we can apply.
      There are two general strategies.
      First, it is often helpful to translate everything into sine and cosine.
      Second, working in the opposite direction,
      it is often helpful to use trig definition to remove fractions,
      so that we only have numerators.
