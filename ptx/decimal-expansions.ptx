  <title>Decimal Expansions for Real Numbers</title>
  <p>
    A nice application of infinite series is a proper and complete account of decimal expansions for real numbers.
    Such expansions have infinite length,
    so some of the standard problems involving infinite process are involved;
    limits are required.
  </p>
  <p>
    The starting question:
    what are decimal expansions and why do infinite strings of decimals actually represent numbers?
    Let's write a real number <m>\alpha</m> as <m>a.d_1d_2d_3d_4 \ldots</m> where
    <m>a \in \NN</m> and the <m>d_i</m> are digits in <m>\{0, 1, \ldots, 9\}</m>.
    The meaning of this decimal expansion is an infinite series.
    <me>
      a + \frac{d_1}{10} + \frac{d_2}{100} + \frac{d_3}{1000} + \frac{d_4}{10000} + \frac{d_5}{100000} + \ldots \implies \alpha = a + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{d_n}{10^n}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Asymptotically, since the numerators are bounded by <m>9</m>,
    this series behaves like <m>\frac{1}{10^n}</m>.
    The terms <m>\frac{1}{10^n}</m> are terms of a geometric series with common ratio <m>\frac{1}{10}</m>,
    which is convergent, so the decimal expansion is also convergent.
    Therefore, we can be confident that decimal expansions,
    though infinite, are a reasonable representation of real numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now think about the partial sums of a decimal expansion.
    <me>
      s_n = a + \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{d_k}{10^k}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    These are all finite sums of fractions,
    hence they are rational numbers.
    Any real number <m>\alpha</m> is the limit of sums of this type,
    since its decimal expansion is the limit of the partial series sums.
    This establishes an important and useful fact about real numbers (sometimes even taken as the definition of real numbers)

      <p>
        All real numbers are limits of sequences of rational numbers.
