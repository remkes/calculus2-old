        We could try to calculate the following integral.
        <me>
          \int_0^2 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} dx = \int_0^2 x^\frac{-1}{2} dx = \left. 2x^{\frac{1}{2}} \right|_0^2 = 2\sqrt{2} - 0 = 2\sqrt{2}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        We get a nice, finite answer.
        However, this is a bit surprising.
        Look at the graph of the function in <xref ref="figure-improper-integral1">Figure</xref>.
      </p>

    <image width="400%" source="images/figure08.png" />
  </figure>
  <p>
    The function has a vertical asymptote at <m>x=0</m>,
    which is the edge of the domain of definition.
    The function approaches <m>\infty</m> at the edge of the integral.
    What does this mean for the area under the curve?
    Infninity makes the notion of area problematic.

        Sometimes it's not the function that's infinite, but the bounds,
        as in the following integral and the graph in <xref ref="figure-improper-integral2">Figure</xref>.
        <me>
          \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2} dx

        It's not at all obvious how much area there is under the integral as the bounds go off to infinity.
        For improper integrals, we need techniques to deal with these infinities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The technique, unsurprisingly, involves limits.
        For the first integral
        (even though we could evaluate it conventionally)
        the problem exists with the bound <m>0</m>,
        where the function approaches <m>\infty</m>.
        We define the improper integral using a limit to approach the asymptote.
        <me>
          \int_0^2 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} dx = \lim_{a \rightarrow 0} \int_a^2 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} dx
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The limit integral is perfectly well defined for <m>a>0</m>,
        since it avoids the asymptote of the function.
        <me>
          \lim_{a \rightarrow 0} \int_a^2 x^\frac{-1}{2} = \lim_{a \rightarrow 0} \left. 2\sqrt{x} \right|_a^2 = \lim_{a \rightarrow 0} 2 \sqrt{a} - 0 = 2 \sqrt{2}
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The same techniques applies to the infinite bounds.
        <me>
          \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2} dx = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \int_1^a \frac{1}{x^2} dx = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \left. \frac{-1}{x} \right|_1^a = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \frac{-1}{a} + 1 = 1
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        In this way,
        we see that the unknown area under the curve of <m>\frac{1}{x^2}</m> is indeed finite,
        even when the bound goes to infinity.
        However, infinite area can also happen.

        Consider a very similar integral.
        <me>
          \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x} dx = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \int_1^a \frac{1}{x} dx = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \left. \ln |x| \right|_1^a = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \ln a - 0 = \infty
        </me>

    </statement>
  </example>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        With improper integrals, finite answers are not guaranteed.
        If the integral is indeed finite,
        we say that the improper integral <term>converges</term>.
        Otherwise, we say that the improper integral <term>diverges</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let's look more carefully at the previous two examples.
        Both had integrands of the form
        <m>\frac{1}{x^p}</m> for some exponent <m>p</m>.
        We know that <m>p=1</m> gives a divergent integral and <m>p=2</m> gives a convergent integral.
        If <m>p \lt 1</m> then <m>\frac{1}{x^p} > \frac{1}{x}</m>.
        If one positive function is larger than another,
        then the area under its graph must be larger.
        Since the area under <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> between <m>1</m> and <m>\infty</m> is already <m>\infty</m>,
        the integral of <m>\frac{1}{x^p}</m> on
        <m>(1,\infty)</m> must also be <m>\infty</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, if <m>p\lt 1</m>, let's make the general calculation.
        <md>
          <mrow>\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^p} = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \int_1^a \frac{1}{x^p} dx = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \left. \frac{-1}{(p-1)x^{p-1}} \right|_1^a = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{p-1} -\frac{1}{(p-1)a^{p-1}} = \frac{1}{p-1}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        For, for <m>p>1</m>, these all converge.
        However, <m>p</m> gets close to <m>1</m>,
        the values of the integrals get very large.
        <m>p=1</m> is the crossover point,
        where the area under the curve becomes infinite.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    We've already implicitly used a comparison argument.
    We said that <m>\frac{1}{x^p} > \frac{1}{x}</m> for <m>p\lt 1</m> and used that fact to argue convergence.
    This comes from a general property of integrals:
    if <m>f(x) \geq g(x)</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>, then
    <me>
      \int_a^b f(x) dx \geq \int_a^b g(x)
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The same inequality holds for improper integrals,
    if we allow the obvious statement that
    <m>\infty > a</m> for any finite number <m>a</m>.
    This type of comparison is useful for evaluating improper integrals.
    However, a more useful comparison makes use of asymptotic analysis.
    I'll state the result this way:
    the asymptotic order of a integrand determines the convergence of an improper integral.
  </p>
  <p>
    What does this mean?
    If means that if we only care about convergence/divergence
    (and not the exact value of the integral),
    then we only need to consider the asymptotic order of the integrand.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <me>
        \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{4 + x + 18x^2}
      </me>
      <p>
        The asymptotic order of the denominator is <m>x^2</m>.
        Therefore, the convenge behaviour is the same as if the integrand were <m>\frac{1}{x^2}</m>.
        This is <m>p=2</m>, which is <m>p>1</m>,
        so the integral converges.
        This use of asymptotic order allows us to dramatically simply the situation:
        we don't have to evaluate the complicated quadratic integral to determine convergence or divergence. (We would,
        of course,
        have to evaluate the complicated quadratic integral if we wanted to determine the exact value of the improper integral).
