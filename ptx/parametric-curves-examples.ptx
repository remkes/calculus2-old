          Consider the curve <m>\gamma_1(t) = (t,t)</m> for <m>t \in [0,5]</m>.
          This curves gives the line <m>y=x</m>,
          starting at <m>(0,0)</m> and ending at <m>(5,5)</m>.
          At <m>t=0</m>, the curve is at <m>(0,0)</m>, at <m>t=1</m>,
          it is at <m>(1,1)</m>, and so on.
          All parametric curves are about movement:
          this is not only the line <m>y=x</m>,
          but also the starting point <m>(0,0)</m>,
          the ending point <m>(5,5)</m> and the rate of movement along the line.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the curve <m>\gamma_2(t) = (-t,-t)</m> for <m>t \in [-5,0]</m>.
          This is exactly the same line,
          since it still satisfies <m>y=x</m>.
          However, now we start at <m>(5,5)</m> when <m>t=-5</m>,
          and we move towards <m>(0,0)</m> when <m>t=0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Now consider the curve <m>\gamma_3(t) = (t^2,t^2)</m> for <m>t \in [0,\sqrt{5}]</m>.
          Again, this is the same line and, like <m>\gamma_1</m>,
          it starts at <m>(0,0)</m> and ends at <m>(5,5)</m>.
          However, it travels the distance a smaller parameter domain,
          meaning that it moves faster.

        <p>
          A classic example is <m>\gamma(t) = (\cos t, \sin t)</m> for <m>t \in [0,2\pi]</m>.
          This curve is just the unit circle,
          traced counter clockwise, starting at <m>(1,0)</m>.
          We could change the parameter domain.
          If we have <m>t \in [0,8\pi]</m>,
          then we have four periods of <m>\sin t</m> and <m>\cos t</m>,
          so this traces the same circle four times.
          This is a good example of a parametric curve which traces over itself some number of times.

          Curves can quickly get complicated.
          Consider this curve: <m>\gamma(t) = (\cos 3t, \sin 5t)</m>.
          This gives a lovely pattern, perhaps reminiscent of spirographs
          (depending on your childhood experience, of course).
          The curve is shown in <xref ref="figure-parametric-curve2">Figure</xref>.

          The next example is called the cycloid.
          Many curves have history going back hundreds or thousands of years in geometry,
          as evidenced by their greek names.
          The cycloid is the curve <m>\gamma(t) = (a(t-\sin t), a(1-\cos t))</m>.
          It describes the movement of a point at the edge of a wheel as the wheel rolls.

    <p>
      Many parametric curves are spirals.
      The general form for a spiral is
      <m>\gamma(t) = (f(t) \cos t, f(t) \sin t)</m> for <m>f(t)</m> a positive monotonic function.
      <m>f(t)</m> represents the change in radius as we go around a circle.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The archemidean spiral is this curve:
          <m>\gamma(t) = (t \cos t, t \sin t)</m>.
          It has linear growth in its radius,
          so there are equally spaced spiral arms.
        </p>
      </statement>

        <p>
          The hyperbolic spiral is an inward spiral,
          (it has decreasing radius).
          Its expression is <m>\gamma(t) = (\frac{\cos t}{t}, \frac{\sin t}{t})</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <statement>
        <p>
          The last spiral in our examples is the logarithmic spiral which has exponential growth in radius.
          Its form is <m>\gamma(t) = (e^{t} \cos t, e^{t} \sin t)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

      <caption>The Logarithmic Spiral</caption>
      <image width="800%" source="images/figure15.png" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      The logarithmic spiral shows up frequently,
      both in mathematics and the natural world.
      Examples of natural logarithmic spirals include nautilus shells and spiral galaxies
      (though the natural application of the logarithmic spiral is not without some contraversy).
    </p>

          A final example, which is not a spiral, is the cardiod.
          It has the form <m>\gamma(t) = ((1-\sin t) \cos t, (1-\sin t) \sin t</m>.
          The name comes from its vaguely heart-shaped path.

  <subsection xml:id="reparametrization">
    <title>Reparametrization</title>
    <p>
      A parametric curve is more than just a shape in <m>\RR^2</m>.
      The curve also records the start,
      end and direction, as well as the rate of movement along the shape.
      All that information depends on the
      <em>parametrization</em>:
      the way in which position depends on the parameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes we want to adjust the movement along the shape,
      while preserving the shape.
      We can do that by changing the parametrization:
      this is called <em>reparametrization</em>.
      The idea is to replace the parameter <m>t</m> by a new parameter <m>s</m>.
      Say we have a curve <m>\gamma(t) = (x(t),y(t))</m>,
      but we can express <m>t</m> as a function of some other variable <m>s</m>,
      <m>t = t(s)</m>.
      Then we can replace <m>t</m> with <m>t(s)</m> in the definition of the curve
      (much like we replace in a integration substitution).
      That gives a new parametrization of the same curve:
      <m>\gamma(s) = (x(t(s)),y(t(s)))</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circle <m>\gamma(t) = (\cos t, \sin t)</m> can be reparametrized in a variety of ways.
      <m>t(s) = s^2</m> gives <m>(\cos s^2, \sin s^2)</m>.
      <m>t(s) = \sqrt{s}</m> gives <m>(\cos \sqrt{s}, \sin \sqrt{s})</m>.
      Each reparametrization doesn't change the shape,
      but does change the rate at which we move around the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each curve shape in <m>\RR^2</m> has many
      (infinitely many)
      parametrizations.
