  <title>Values of Infinite Series</title>
  <p>
    In all the examples of the previous section,
    we have been testing series convergence.
    One might complain that we are ignoring the more practical question of actually calculating the values.
    However, the problem of finding closed form expressions for the values of series is difficult.
    Consider the following series.
    <me>
      \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^2+4n}{(n!)2^n}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is easy to check for convergence:
    therefore, this does converge to a number.
    Can we say what number?
    Most likely the number is some number we simply don't recognize,
    some irrational number which has no name.
    This is an inherent issue with series:
    often the series itself is the best representation of the new number,
    whatever it is.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, we would often like to know the rough value of the number.
    We can use the series to approximate the number.
    In the previous example,
    we can approximate the sum by its fourth partial sum.
    <me>
      \frac{5}{2} + \frac{12}{8} + \frac{21}{48} + \frac{32}{384} = \frac{217}{48}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    If we add more terms, we get a closer approximation.
    Other than this series of improving approximations,
    we really don't know what it is.
    The accuracy and precision of our approximation is an important question in the study of infinite series;
    we will return to it at the end of the next chapter.
