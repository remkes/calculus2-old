  <title>The Substitution Rule</title>

    <p>
      Note: this section is a copy of the same section from Calculus
      I. It's repeated here because it is the most important of the
      integration rules and will be used frequently in the discussion of
      integration in this course. It's worth repeating to make sure you
      understand it well.

    <title>Differentiating Composition</title>
    <p>
      Since doing integrals is doing derivatives backwards, it might
      be reasonable to try to reversing all the differentiation rules.
      Linearity works exactly the same in reverse. The inverted power
      rule works very similarly to the original power rule. After the
      power rule, thouhg, the remaining rules don't easily reverse.
      For most of these rules, I'll leave the strategies 
      for Calculus II. But I do want to cover how to do the chain rule
      backwards, which is the subject of this entire week. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a composition of functions <m>f(g(x))</m>, the derivative is
      calculated by the chain rule.
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = f^\prime(g(x)) g^\prime(x)
      </me>
      The simplest reversal of the chain rule is to integrate the
      right side to produce the left. 
      <me>
        \int f^\prime(g(x)) g^\prime(x) dx = f(g(x)) + c
      </me>
      When I covered the chain rule, I recommended labelling the inside
      function with a new variable <m>u = g(x)</m>. This labelling
      becomes essential now. To implement the inverse of the chain
      rule, I'm essentially going to change the integral from the old
      variable <m>x</m> to a new variable <m>u</m> using this
      labelling <m>u = g(x)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gives me a process, which is called the substitution rule.
      For a integral that looks something like the output of a chain
      rule, I'll try to choose an inside function and label it <m>u =
      g(x)</m>. Then I'll differentiate and write the following
      equation.
    </p>
    <me>
      du = g^\prime(x) dx 
    </me>
    <p>
      The <m>dx</m> in the integral is not just a piece of notation
      that indicates the variable. It's actually part of the integral
      itself, even though it disappears in the anti-derivative
      process. (This <m>dx</m> term is, quite confusingly, called the
      <term>differential</term>.) When I do the substitution rule, I
      need to replace the old differential <m>dx</m> with the new
      differential<m>du</m>. However, I can't just replace it
      directy. The previous equation gives me the appropriate
      replacement: I need to replace <m>g^\prime(x) dx</m> with
      <m>du</m>. Lastly, if there are any other piece of the original
      integral which aren't accounted for in the replacements I've
      done so far, I need to figure a way to replace those pieces as
      well, usually going some algebra with the new variable <m>u</m>.
      The key idea is that all of the original pieces of the original
      variable <mdash /> all of the <m>x</m>'s, must be replace with
      <m>u</m>. The old integral is entirely in <m>x</m>; the new
      integral is entirely in <m>u</m>. Once I've done the
      substitution, I get a new integral in <m>u</m> which is hopefuly
      easier to calculate than the original. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is difficult to understand from the general description, so
      I'll go direclty into a bunch of examples which show the
      technique.

    <title>Substitution Examples - Indefinite Integrals</title>
    <example>
     <statement>
        <me>
         \int 2x (x^2+1)^4 dx
        </me>
        <p>
          This looks like a composition, with an inside function 
          <m>x^2 + 1</m>. I'll try a substitution <m>u = x^2 +1</m> to
          see if it makes the integral more reasonable.  I need to
          change the differential term; here, <m>u = x^2 +1</m>, so
          <m>du = (2x) dx</m>. If I regroup the terms in the original
          integral, I can replace <m>2x dx</m> with <m>du</m>. This
          lets me replace all of the <m>x</m> variables. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \int (x^2+1)^4 (2x)dx \mapsto \int u^4 du
        </me>
        <p>
          Then can find the anti-derivative by reversing the
          power rule.
        </p>
        <me>
          \int u^4 du = \frac{u^5}{5} + c
        </me>
        <p>
          After I find an antiderivative in the new variable <m>u</m>,
          I need to return to the original variable by undoing the
          substitution. I simply replace <m>u</m> with <m>x^2+1</m>.
          This gives me an antiderivative for the original function in
          the original variable.
        </p>
        <me>
          \int 2x (x^2+1)^4 dx = \int u^4 du = \frac{u^5}{5} + c =
          \frac{(x^2+1)^5}{5} + c

      <statement>
        <me>
          \int xe^{x^2} dx = \int (e^{x^2}) (xdx) 
        </me>
        <p>
          I use the substitution <m>u = x^2</m>. The matching change
          in the differential is <m>du = 2xdx</m>. I've grouped
          <m>xdx</m> in the integral; I can replace this with <m>
          \frac{1}{2} du</m>. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \int e^{x^2} xdx = \int e^u \frac{1}{2} du  =
          \frac{1}{2} \int e^u du 
        </me>
        <p>
          After taking out the constant, I get the integral of
          <m>e^u</m>, which is an integral I know. I can finish the
          integral and then replace the substitution with the original
          function.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \int \frac{x}{x-2} dx 
        </me>
        <p>
          Here there isn't as obvious a substitution. However, I might
          be able to simplify the denominator by using the
          substitution <m>u = x - 2</m>. The matching differential
          substitution is simply <m>du = dx</m>. I also need to
          substitute the numerator. I can do this by adding <m>2</m>
          to each side of the substitution, giving <m>u + 2 = x</m>.
        </p>
        <me>
          \int \frac{x}{x-2} dx = \int \frac{u+2}{u} du 
        </me>
        <p>
          Then I can split this into two pieces, since
          <m>\frac{u+2}{u} = \frac{u}{u} + \frac{2}{u} = 1 +
          \frac{2}{u}</m>. After that, I can use linear to split this
          into two integrals. The integral of a constant is <m>u</m>
          and the integral of <m>\frac{1}{u}</m>, from the tables, is
          <m>\ln |u|</m>. Finally, at the end I reverse the
          substitution.
        </p>
        <me>
          = \int 1 + \frac{2}{u} du = \int du + 2 \int
          \frac{1}{u} du  = u + 2 \ln |u| + c = x - 2 + 2\ln|x-2| + c
        </me>
        <p>
          The <m>-2</m> could be combined with the constant <m>c</m>,
          since the constant is unknown. This isn't necessary, but you
          could write the solution with slightly fewer characters with
          this change.
        </p>

          = x + 2 \ln|x-2| + c

      <statement>
        <me>
          \int \frac{1}{10x-3} dx 
        </me>
        <p>
          I use the substitution <m>u = 10x - 3</m>, again to simplify
          the denominator. The associated change to the differential
          is <m>du = 10dx</m>, which I can rearrange to
          <m>\frac{1}{10} du = dx</m>.
        </p>
        <me>
          \int \frac{1}{10x - 3} = \int \frac{1}{u} \frac{1}{10} du
        </me>
        <p>
          I can pull out the constant. Then the antiderivative of
          <m>\frac{1}{u}</m> is known from the tables. After the
          antiderivative, I can reverse the substitution to return to
          the original variable.

    <title>Substitution Examples - Definite Integrals</title>
    <p>
      When I do substitution with definite integrals, I also need to
      change the bounds. If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the bounds in
      <m>x</m> and <m>u = g(x)</m> is the relationship between <m>u</m>
      and <m>x</m>, then <m>g(a)</m> and <m>g(b)</m> will be the bounds
      in <m>u</m>. One nice thing about definite integrals is that I
      can use these new bounds to evaluate the integral. I don't have
      to substitute back after I finish.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <me>
          \int_0^2 \frac{2x}{(x^2+1)^2} dx 
        </me>
        <p>
          I use the substitution <m>u = x^2 + 1</m>, with the matching
          differential change <m>du = 2x dx</m>. Since there is a
          <m>2x dx</m> in the integral, no more algebra is necessary.
          I also need to change the bounds. When <m>x=0</m>, <m>u =
          x^2 + 1 = 1</m>; when <m>x = 2</m>. <m>u = 2^2 + 1 = 5</m>.

          \int_0^2 \frac{2x}{(x^2+1)^2} = \int_1^5 \frac{1}{u^2} du
        </me>
        <p>
          Then I can write <m>\frac{1}{u^2}</m> as <m>u^{-2}</m> and
          use the reverse power rule to find the antiderivative. After
          finding the antiderivative, I evalute on the bounds (with
          the change in the bounds, there is no need to reverse the
          substitution).

        <p>
          I use the substitution <m>u = x^3</m> with the matching
          differential substitution <m>du = 3x^2 dx</m>. Since only
          <m>x^2 dx </m> shows up in the integral, I divide by
          <m>3</m> to get <m> \frac{1}{3} du = x^2 dx</m>. I also need
          to change the bounds. When <m>x = -1</m>, <m>u = (-1)^3 + 1
          = 0</m>. When <m> x = 2</m>, <m>u = (2)^3 + 1 = 9</m>. All
          this information lets me perform the substitution.

          Then I can factor out the constant and use the fact that

        <p>
          I use the substituton <m>u = \cos x</m> with matching
          differential substitution <m>du = -\sin x dx </m>. Since
          there isn't a negative in the the integral, I can adjust
          this by multiplying by <m>-1</m> to get <m> -du = \sin x dx
          </m>. I also need to change the bounds. When <m>x = 0</m>,
          <m>u = \cos 0 = 1</m>, and when <m>x = \frac{\pi}{4}, u =
          \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{4} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}</m>.
