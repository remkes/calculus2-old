  <title>Solvable Integrals</title>
  <p>
    In Calculus I, we went through many techniques and rules for
    differentiation (chain rule, product rule, quotient rule, etc),
    but only one major technique for integration (the substitution
    rule). In this course, we try to fill in the remaining major
    techniques of integration.

    Integration is much more difficult than differentiation.
    Through we will develop several techniques, they have somewhat
    limited application. There are many integrals that simply
    defeat all of our methods.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        On of the best example is the very useful Gaussian
        distribution function: <m>f(x) = e^{-x^2}</m>. We consider
        its integral.
        <me>
          \int e^{-x^2} dx
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a very useful integral, as we shall see in our
        section on probability. However, for our current purposes,
        it is entirely unsolvable. There is no function among the
        elementary functions that serves as an anti-derivative. In
        that sense, the integral is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        In another sense, though, the integral is fine. The
        integrand is continuous, so an anti-derivative does exist.
        We simply don't have a name for it yet. It's a new,
        interesting, unknown function. This is often the case.
        There are many integrals we simply can't do with elementary
        functions. From the veiwpoint of elementary functions,
        these are defeats <mdash/> impossible integrals. From a
        broader viewpoint, these are sources of new and interesting
        functions.

    That said, this section is focused on those integrals which can
    be solved by elementary functions. We have several techniques
    which apply to particular integral forms and do give elementary
    function solutions.

    In our study of integration in this course, we will be expanding
    upon the use of the substitution from Calculus I. In many ways,
    substitution is the most important integration rule. It
    behooves us to review the idea. (The remainder of this section
    is copied verbatim from the Calculus I notes).
