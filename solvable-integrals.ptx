  <title>Solvable Integrals</title>
  <p>
    In Calculus I, I went through many techniques and rules for
    differentiation (chain rule, product rule, quotient rule, etc),
    but only one major technique for integration (the substitution
    rule). In this course, I aim to cover in the remaining major
    techniques of integration.

    Integration is much more difficult than differentiation. For
    elementary functions, the derivative rules are a complete set of
    tools: any elementary function has a derivative which is another
    elementary function and that derivative can be calculated using
    the known rules. For integrals, the situations is entirely
    different. The rules are much less algorithmic; there is much more
    guess work involved. More importantly, sometimes none of the rules
    work at all. This is important enough a statement that I'll put it
    in a quote block.

    There are elementary functions <m>f(x)</m> such that the integral
    <m>\int f(x) dx</m> has not solution which is an elementary
    function.

        Unfortunately, some of the most useful and important functions
        in mathematics are functions that have no elementary
        antiderivatives. The Guassian distribution (often called the
        bell curve) is central to statistics. This is the function 
        <m>f(x) = e^{-x^2}</m>. Consider its integral.
        <me>
          \int e^{-x^2} dx
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a very useful integral, as I shall discuss in <xref
        ref="section-probability" />. But its integral is unsolvable
        by elementary function. By the tools introduced in this
        course, the integral is unsolvable. 
      </p>
    </statement>

    I've been talking about integral that are solvable by elementary
    functions. However, the class of solvable integrals is much larger
    than this is I allow myself to consider non-elementary functions.
    An integral <m>f(x) dx</m> might not have a elementary
    antiderivaitve, but it still might have some other kind of
    elementary derivative. In fact, here is a nice proposition that tells
    us when antiderivative exist.
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f: [a,b] \rightarrow \RR</m> be a continuous function.
        Then <m>f</m> has an antiderivative which is defined on the
        interval <m>[a,b]</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <p>
    So these <sq>unsolvable</sq> integrals actually do have solutions.
    There are functions which are the antiderivatives of these
    fucntions. They are just not elementary functions. They are new
    functions, with new names, new properties, new behaviour. In fact,
    integrals without elementary antiderivatives are one of the most
    significant source of new functions. There is a whole enormous
    branch of mathematics that studies all these other functions:
    names them, calculate their values, determines their properties. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This brings up an important and subtle theme in mathematics: what,
    really, is a solution? To take the example above, does <m>\int
    e^{-x^2} dx</m> have a solution? If, for a solution, you mean an
    elemetary function, then the answer is no. If, for a solution, you
    mean any function (possibly an entirely new and unknown function),
    then the answer is yes. Whether a mathematical problem has an
    answer can very much depend on the subtleties of how we ask. 
  </p>
  <p>
    All that said, in this course I will keep to integrals which have
    elementary solutions. Even restricted to this domain, there are
    many techniques and many useful functions whose antiderivatives
    can be calculated.
